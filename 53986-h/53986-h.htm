<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>TOMMY PARISH, CRITIC</small></h2>


<p>“Put some glue on your hands, Chick!” advised
Tommy Parish in a clear, carrying voice from
his seat in the front row of the stand. The sally
gained a ripple of laughter from the somewhat
apathetic audience. Bert Hollins, huddled under
a blanket on the players’ bench, a few yards
away, turned a mildly indignant countenance
toward Tommy and was met with a wide grin
and a jovial wink. Across the field, Chick Burton,
right end, captured the trickling pigskin and
tossed it disgustedly toward the referee. The
disgust was natural, for Chick had just missed
his third forward-pass in that quarter.</p>

<p>Alton Academy was playing its first game of
the season, with Southport School, and the third
period was well along. Southport had scored a
field-goal in the first quarter and Alton a touchdown
in the second. Nip Storer had failed to
kick the goal after the latter event. It had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
drizzling ever since noon, and a wet ball and a
slippery field were not making for brilliant playing.
For that matter, however, even had the
weather conditions been of the best it is doubtful
if either team would have put up a good game,
for both were slow and ragged, missing numerous
opportunities to score and plainly badly in need
of practice. Perhaps Chick Burton was no worse
than the others, but that was a matter of opinion,
and Tommy Parish’s opinion was to the effect
that Chick was the principal offender of the
afternoon. If Chick had caught just one of the
throws from Jim Galvin, Alton would be in possession
of twelve points instead of six. At least,
so Tommy thought.</p>

<p>Tommy sat with his knees hunched up almost
to his chin and munched peanuts. Tommy was
usually munching something. He was a short,
heavy youth with a round face and a liability to
boils on the back of his brief neck. Indeed, it
was quite an unfamiliar sight to see Tommy
without at least one protective arrangement of
gauze and plaster between his collar and the
edge of his pale brown hair. Because his seat
was in the front row of the grand-stand, he was
able to perch his feet on the edge of the barrier
and so form a sort of trough between legs and
stomach for the accommodation of his bag of
peanuts. When not dipping into the bag or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
deftly detaching the shells from their contents
he snuggled his hands under the edge of his thick
blue sweater. Since Tommy never wore a hat at
school—whatever he did at home—a fact which
may account to some extent for the faded tone
of his hair, he presented a rather damp and bedraggled
appearance. Drops trickled down his
somewhat button-like nose, encircled his slightly
protrusive ears and quivered on his round chin as
it moved ceaselessly and rhythmically during the
process of mastication. But if moist, he was quite
happy. Give Tommy something to eat and something
to look on at and weather conditions meant
nothing in his young life. His was a cheerful disposition,
and if those who smarted under the frank
expressions of his judgment frequently wanted
very, very much to murder him, Tommy cared not
a whit. He believed in being outspoken, in giving
candid publicity to his opinions; in short, Tommy
hewed to the line and let the chips fall wherever
they blame pleased!</p>

<p>The game went on, Southport capturing the ball
after Fitz Savell, playing at half, had let it ooze
from his arms. Tommy set his strong, white teeth
on a particularly attractive peanut and observed
reproachfully, “Why don’t you hand it to him,
Fitz, ’stead of making him pick it up that way?
Where’s your manners, boy?”</p>

<p>Homer Johnson, two rows back, reached a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
leg across the intervening seat and placed a foot
against the back of Tommy’s head. Tommy’s
head went suddenly forward with a jerk and two
peanuts fell to the wet boards, a total loss. “Cut
out the merry quips, Tommy,” advised Homer.
“You weary me.”</p>

<p>Tommy turned his head cautiously. As a matter
of fact he happened to be free from boils at the moment,
but affliction had taught him caution in the
matter of moving his neck and it had become second-nature.
He observed Homer without rancor.
“Hello,” he said. “Great game, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“The game’s bad enough, Tommy, without any
help from you,” answered Homer coldly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Homer, you’re wrong,” responded
Tommy affably. “Nothing’s so bad it can’t be
helped. Constructive criticism, Homer, old timer,
is never inopportune, never <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mal venu</i>.” Tommy
delighted in French phrases which he pronounced
with a fine New England accent. He knew just
how far he could go with Homer Johnson without
getting into trouble, and it is doubtful if he would
have risked that “old timer” had they not been
separated by a row of seats and their occupants.
Homer was a senior and Tommy still no more
than a sophomore, although others who had been
his classmates last year were now juniors. Homer
frowned but contented himself with “Shut up,
Tommy!” delivered sharply. Tommy smiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
placidly and slowly returned his gaze to the peanut
bag.</p>

<p>“Crazy kid,” commented Freeman Naughton,
grinning as soon as Tommy’s head was turned
away. “I’ve wanted to kill him fifty times since
I’ve been here!”</p>

<p>“He’d have been dead long ago if I’d yielded to
my desire,” chuckled Homer. “Tommy bears a
charmed life, I guess. Gets away with stuff that
would get another fellow kicked from here to State
street. Did you hear what he got off on Jonas the
other day? He and another fellow were passing
in front of Upton and the ball got away from him
just as Jonas came along and Tommy yelled,
‘Thank you, Jonas!’ Well, you know the way
Jonas moves when he isn’t playing football. He
ambled along and picked up the ball and looked at
it and finally tossed it back, and Tommy yelled,
‘Say, listen! I want to ask you something! Is
your name Jonas Lowe or is it Jonah Slow?’ I
guess Jonas wanted to slaughter him, but he let
him live.”</p>

<p>Naughton—he went by the name of “Naughty,”
naturally enough—chuckled. “The cheekiest thing
he ever did, though, was in our freshman year. I
guess I told you.”</p>

<p>“About Kincaid?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Kincaid had wandered off the lesson, the
way he does, and was telling the class something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
he’d seen in Rome or some place; something about
some ruins; and Tommy pipes up with: ‘Mr. Kincaid,
haven’t those ruins been there a long time?’
‘Why, yes, Parish,’ says Kincaid, ‘some thousands
of years.’ ‘Then,’ says Tommy sweetly, ‘maybe
they’ll keep, sir, if we go on with the lesson.’”</p>

<p>The quarter came to an end with the score still
6 to 3, the teams changed goals and Mr. Cade, the
coach, familiarly known as Johnny, hustled a set
of bedraggled substitutes from the bench and sent
them trotting in to report. Jake, the trainer,
wrapped the deposed ones in dry blankets and circulated
an already soiled towel about on which they
wiped their wet faces. The game started off on
its final period with a new backfield, save for Galvin,
at full, and two new linemen. Southport introduced
two fresh ends, but made no other
changes. Southport made a determined drive for
the Alton goal and got the pigskin as far as the
twenty-eight yards, where, after two attempts at
the Gray-and-Gold’s line had yielded scant returns,
and a short forward-pass had gone wrong, her left
half dropped back and tried to duplicate his feat of
the first quarter. But this time he was hurried
and the ball slanted off to the left and passed well
beyond the goal post. Storer punted on second
down and Southport got the pigskin again on
Alton’s forty-six. Once more she tried desperately
to reach a point from which to score by kicking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
A wide sweep gained but two yards and a
smash straight at the center of the line was good
for as many more. Then, however, a puzzling
double pass sent a back inside Dozier, at left tackle,
and the runner dodged and twirled to the thirty-three
before he was nailed by Ball, the Alton quarter-back.</p>

<p>Again Southport tried the ends, first one and
then the other, and the ball went out of bounds on
the second play. With about twenty-eight to go
on a third down and the ball well to the side of
the gridiron, a place-kick looked unpromising, and
when the visitor set the stage for it Alton was incredulous.
Warnings of a forward-pass were
cried, but when the ball went back it sped straight
to the kneeling quarter and was set to the ground.
The kicker was deliberate and Chick Burton, slipping
past the defense, almost blocked the ball, but
it passed him safely, sailed up and over the cross-bar
and added another three points to Southport’s
score and tied the game.</p>

<p>Alton didn’t have a chance to better her figures
during the few minutes that remained. Southport,
evidently as pleased with results as if she had won,
set herself on the defensive and held the enemy
safely away from her goal. The stand was almost
empty by the time the last whistle blew. In the
front row of seats, however, Tommy Parish still
huddled, arising at last with a sigh of repletion and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
a deluge of peanut shells to the ground. Then,
sinking his neck into the collar of his sweater and
his moist hands into the pockets of his baggy
breeches, he turned from the scene of conflict and
made his way back across the soggy field toward
Upton Hall. Ahead, the tired players plodded
along by twos and threes, blankets trailing, subdued
and disgruntled. Toward the end of the procession
Coach Cade’s short, thick-set figure walked
beside that of Captain Lowe. Jonas was almost
six feet tall and correspondingly broad, and walked
with a lumbering pace that added to the contrast
between him and Johnny. The gymnasium swallowed
them up and Tommy went on, passing within
smelling distance of the kitchens in Lawrence Hall
and sniffing the air eagerly. This was a Saturday,
and generally on Saturdays the evening meal was
extremely satisfactory. Tommy almost regretted
those peanuts. Still, nearly an hour must elapse
before he would be allowed to assimilate more
food, and Tommy’s recuperative powers were of
the best. He reached the walk between Borden
and Upton, turned to the right and presently disappeared
into the latter dormitory.</p>

<p>Up in Number 30 Tommy removed his outer
garments, swathed his rotund form in a garish
blanket dressing-gown and subsided on the window-seat,
piling the several silken pillows behind
his head. The view was not cheerful just now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Through the mist-covered panes Tommy looked
across the Yard, damply green of turf, to Academy
street and the white residences beyond. There
were few persons in sight. Up the middle path
came a figure in a shining yellow oil-skin coat,
snuggling a package under an arm; one of the
fellows returning from a shopping expedition, apparently.
Tommy wondered whether the contents
of the package were edible. A few forms moved
along Academy street, citizens with umbrellas
these. To the right, near the Meadow street side
of the Yard, a light appeared in Doctor McPherson’s
house. (“Mac” was the principal.) Occupying
a corresponding position across the wide
expanse of maple dotted turf, Memorial Hall emitted
two fellows carrying books from the school library.
Tommy watched them idly as they followed
the walk which led them to the front of Academy
Hall. As they passed Upton he recognized the
taller of the two and had half a mind to raise the
window and exchange insults. But the effort was
too great and he contented himself with tapping
a pane with the seal ring he wore. Evidently the
sound didn’t carry, for the youths disappeared
from his range of vision without looking up.</p>

<p>At Alton Academy the dormitories form a line
across the top of the campus: Haylow first, near
Meadow street, then Lykes, then—with Academy
Hall intervening—Upton and Borden. Back of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Academy is Lawrence, which is the dining hall, and
well over toward River street, hiding behind Borden,
is the Carey Gymnasium. The land descended
gently each way from the dormitory row, in the
front toward Academy street and the town, in the
rear toward the open country. On the latter slope,
a slope too gradual to really deserve the name, was
the athletic field, with the quarter-mile track,
diamonds, tennis courts and sufficient territory besides
for the accommodation of such mildly important
bodies as the soccer and lacrosse teams.
Like many New England preparatory schools,
Alton possessed an appearance of age out of proportion
with fact, an appearance largely due to
the maples that shaded the walks and the ivy that
grew almost to the eaves of the older buildings.
Not that Alton was a new school, for it was not,
but it was younger than many; younger, even, than
its principal rival, Kenly Hall, over at Lakeville.</p>

<p>Tommy was getting quite drowsy now and would
probably have fallen comfortably asleep if Billy
Pillsbury hadn’t selected the moment for his homecoming.
Billy, generally called “Pill” was sixteen,
a sophomore—although, unlike Tommy, he
was new at it—and held the proud and important
position of Second Assistant Football Manager.
Pill was a slight, pink-cheeked, trim-looking youth,
with dark hair swept back from a classic brow
and held swept by some fragrant concoction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
that Tommy found particularly nauseating—or
pretended to. Pill entered with the aspect of one
wearied by the weight of authority imposed on
him and sank into a chair. Tommy viewed him
without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Gee, what a day!” sighed Pill.</p>

<p>“Yes, rotten,” responded the other, carefully
misunderstanding. “Doesn’t look much like clearing,
either.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the weather!” Pill put that aside with a
wave of a slender hand. “I meant the—the work.
And that game! Say, wasn’t that criminal,
Tommy?”</p>

<p>“Sure was. Every fellow on the team deserves
hanging.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” protested Pill. “They’re
all right. Trouble is, they haven’t had enough
practice, Tommy.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Ten days ought to give them some
idea of the game!”</p>

<p>“They weren’t any worse than Southport.”</p>

<p>“What of it? Last year we licked Southport
something like 23 to 0. And the year before by—
Well, I forget what it was.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” returned Pill triumphantly. “It was
6 to 6, the same as to-day. And that year we
licked Kenly, and last year we didn’t! So you
can’t prove that the team’s going to be rotten that
way!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m not saying it’s going to be rotten,” answered
Tommy placidly. “All I say is that it was
rotten to-day. Look at the way Burton played,
for instance. He had three chances with forward-passes
and missed every one of them. Touched
them all, too. Why, we’d have had a touchdown
any time if he could have frozen onto just one
of them!”</p>

<p>“Chick was sort of out of tune,” acknowledged
Pill. “He’s been that way ever since work started.
Looks to me as if he was still sore about the
captaincy.”</p>

<p>“Think so?” Tommy looked interested. “Say,
I’ll bet you’re <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tres</i> right! I thought he and Jonas
Lowe weren’t acting awfully thick!”</p>

<p>“Oh, they get on all right,” said Pill. “Still, I
do think that Chick was awfully disappointed last
winter. Maybe you can’t blame him, either. Why,
I’d have bet my shirt that they’d make him captain,
Tommy!”</p>

<p>“Yes, so would I, I guess. The trouble with
Chick Burton is that he’s a mighty pleasant guy,
and most every one likes him a lot and all that.
But when it comes to choosing a leader, why,
Chick doesn’t—er—inspire confidence. That’s the
way I get it, and I guess that’s the way the team
felt last December. It was a surprise, though,
when they elected Lowe. Guess Jonas was as surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
as any one, even Chick. Think he will make
a good captain, Pill?”</p>

<p>“Jonas?” Pill looked frankly dubious. “Gee,
I don’t know, Tommy. He’s a corking old scout,
and the fellows like him well enough; and he knows
a lot about football; his own position and the
other chap’s; but it doesn’t seem to me that he’s
what you’d call a born leader.”</p>

<p>“Huh, neither is Chick.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is, too! Chick’s the—the slap-bang,
hit-or-miss sort that—”</p>

<p>“Mostly miss to-day,” interpolated Tommy.</p>

<p>“—that fellows take to. He may be wrong,
but he makes you think he’s right. And he has—well,
dash, you know; and a jolly way of banging
into everything; sort of a ‘Come on, gang, let’s
go!’ fashion that wins the crowd. What I think
about Chick is that if he had made the captaincy
he’d have been a poor leader, Tommy, but every
one would have forgiven him and, if we’d lost to
Kenly, would have said: ‘Well, it wasn’t Chick
Burton’s fault! It was just rotten luck!’”</p>

<p>“He’s sure got a pal in you,” said Tommy. “I
didn’t know you two were so <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amical</i>.”</p>

<p>“Your French is rotten, as usual. We aren’t
very friendly, either, for that matter. I mean, I
don’t know him very well. Say, that’s a funny
thing about Chick Burton. He gets on finely with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
every one, but you never see him chummy with a
soul. Ever notice that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. What about Hollins? He
and Chick look to be pretty thick.”</p>

<p>“Well, they room together, you know, and I
heard they were pals before they came here. But
outside of Bert Hollins he doesn’t take up with
any fellow, so far as I see.”</p>

<p>Tommy chuckled reminiscently. “You ought to
have seen the pained look on Bert’s face this afternoon
when I razzed Chick once for missing a
throw! Say, that poor nut thinks Chick invented
football, I guess.”</p>

<p>Pill, having finally set about the task of removing
his damp clothing, chuckled as he kicked off
a shoe. “I’ll bet! Bert thinks Chick is just about
all right, I guess. Talk about Damon and Pythias!”</p>

<p>“Well, I fancy it’s a bit one-sided,” replied
Tommy pessimistically. “Friendships generally
are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Chick’s a senior and could
have gone into Lykes this fall if he’d wanted to.
But he stayed here in Upton so’s he could be with
Bert. That looks like he thought a good deal of
him, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Maybe and peradventure,” Tommy yawned.
“Hurry up and get dressed. I’m starved. I see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Bert’s still trying to play football. This is his
third season, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Second. He’s a junior. I dare say he will
make the team this year. He told me the other
day that he’d put on seven pounds since last fall.
He isn’t a bad player. He might have got placed
last fall if he hadn’t been so light. Johnny had
him in a few minutes to-day, at the last.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d like to see him make it,” said Tommy
reflectively. “He’s sure tried hard and long, and
I’m strong on the nil desperandum stuff, Pill.
Who do we play next week?”</p>

<p>“Banning High. Bet you you’ll see a different
game next Saturday, Tommy.”</p>

<p>“If I don’t,” responded the other, “I’ll ask for
my money back! Say, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour l’amour de Michel</i>, do
we eat or don’t we?”</p>

<small>BERT REFUSES AN INVITATION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Want to play some pool?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>Bert leaned back in the chair and caressed the
end of his straight nose with the rubber tip of his
pencil. “Depends,” he replied. “If you mean at
that evil-smelling dive you dragged me into last
week the answer is no, Chick.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Mooney’s?” demanded
the other. “He’s got the best tables in town.”</p>

<p>“I know, but the smoke’s so thick there you
could cut it with a knife, and it makes my eyes
smart. That’s why you beat me last time.”</p>

<p>“Shucks, a little smoke won’t hurt you. Come
on. Besides, when a fellow can’t smoke himself
a little of the aroma of the weed isn’t so bad.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but I noticed the last time that it sort
of made you absent-minded, Chick.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean? Oh, that! Shucks, one
cigarette at this stage of the game doesn’t matter.
We weren’t really in training last Saturday, any
way.”</p>

<p>Bert Hollins smiled and shook his head. “That’s
a punk alibi, Chick. Suppose some one had happened
to look in? There’d been the dickens to
pay.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Some one being Johnny Cade?” asked Chick,
grinning. “Johnny doesn’t frequent that part of
town, old son. Don’t look so blamed virtuous or
I’ll punch your head. Anyway, I’m off the things
until we quit training.”</p>

<p>“Which being so,” said the other, “you’d better
get rid of the box in your top drawer. They might
tempt you, Charles, beyond your power of resistance.”</p>

<p>“Say, how come you’ve been snooping through
my chiffonier? Hang it, Bert, you’ve got a
cheek!”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute! Did you or didn’t you ask me
to get you a handkerchief one day and drop it out
the window to you? And was or wasn’t said handkerchief
in said top drawer of said—”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” said Chick, grinning. “All right,
old son. Say no more. But trust you to see the
fags! As to getting rid of them, that would be
rotten extravagance, Bert. No, but I’ll stick ’em
out of sight where I won’t see ’em. How’ll that
do? But, listen. Will you shoot some pool, or
won’t you, you poor fish?”</p>

<p>“Won’t,” answered Bert. “That is, I will if
you’ll play in a respectable place, but I don’t like
the atmosphere of Rooney’s—”</p>

<p>“Mooney’s.”</p>

<p>“Looney’s, then. And I’m not referring entirely
to the tobacco smoke. A lot of the gentlemen who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
frequent that dive are the sort that my Sunday
school teacher expressly warned me against,
Chick.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut out the comedy stuff,” growled the
older boy. “Come on, won’t you? You don’t have
to pay any attention to the others. I’ll give you
a handicap of—”</p>

<p>“No, thanks, old man, I really had rather not.
Anyway, I’ve got some math here that will stand
an hour’s work.”</p>

<p>“Do it later. Great Scott, don’t you know this is
Saturday night?”</p>

<p>“Sure, but I sort of feel in the mood for math,
Chick. A—a kind of mental alertness possesses
me, and although—”</p>

<p>“Oh, go to thunder!” said Chick shortly, and
pulled a cap on his head. “The next time I ask
you, you’ll know it, you blamed Miss Nancy.”</p>

<p>“Them’s hard words,” murmured Bert.
“What time you coming back?”</p>

<p>“Some time before ten. Why?”</p>

<p>“Just wondered if you recalled the fact that
you’re supposed to be in bed by that hour.”</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em> Who said so? Johnny hasn’t started
that stuff yet, has he?”</p>

<p>“Even so, Chick. He specifically mentioned his
wishes no later than yesterday. Every one in bed
by ten sharp, were his words.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s got a crust,” Chick declared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
“That’s mid-season stuff. How’s he get that
way?”</p>

<p>“I really can’t say, but, joking aside, Charles,
do try to be home by nine-thirty or thereabouts,
eh? These late hours—”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” With his hand on the door,
Chick made a final and pathetic appeal. “Be a
good guy, Bert, won’t you? Listen, we’ll go to
that place on West street, if you can’t stand
Mooney’s.”</p>

<p>Bert waved the pencil in dismissal. “Run along
to your disreputable acquaintances, Chick. Fact
is, I’m not feeling lucky to-night. Besides, I got
a slam on the shin this afternoon that tells me I
wouldn’t enjoy tramping a couple of miles around
a table. Some other time, O Wizard of the Cue.”</p>

<p>“Honest, you make me sick!” The door shut
with some force, leaving Bert smiling at it. He
rather enjoyed ragging Chick, and Chick, while
he sometimes became exasperated, never lost his
temper. Not with Bert, that is. For one thing,
they had known each other ever since they had
begun to walk; or, at least, since Bert had, for
Chick, who was a full year older, had probably
found the use of his legs first. They had grown
up together in Watertown, adventured together,
gone to school together, had been practically inseparable
for some fifteen years. Chick had a temper,
although it was pretty well governed, but save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in the very earliest years of their acquaintance he
had never been really angry with Bert. Perhaps
his year of seniority had something to do with it,
for, although Bert could be trying at times, Chick
considered that the other’s youth excused him.
Each of the boys made a good deal of that thirteen
months of difference in their respective ages.
Chick had always assumed an elder brother attitude,
Bert had always accepted the position of
junior unquestioningly, crediting Chick with superior
wisdom and all the advantages popularly
supposed to accrue to those of great age and experience.
Always, that is, until very recently.
Within the last year, it seemed, the matter of age
had become less important. Possibly, as sometimes
happens, Bert had matured more in that time
than Chick had. Whereas a year back the older
boy had held the rôle of mentor, now it was Bert
who sought to guide Chick’s steps. Sometimes a
slightly puzzled look would come into Chick’s
countenance, indicating that he was sensible of a
difference in their relations and hadn’t yet fathomed
it.</p>

<p>In general appearance the friends were not unalike.
Both were fairly tall, well-proportioned
youths, Bert slimmer and lighter than Chick but
not destined to remain so much longer. Both were
dark of complexion, Chick with gray eyes and Bert
with brown. On the score of good looks the older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
boy held an advantage, for his features were regular,
while Bert’s, with the single exception of a
straight nose, were decidedly haphazard. Still, expression
counts more than features, as a general
thing, and both scored there, although in different
fashions. Chick’s face told of high spirits and
vivacity and thirst for adventure, and a ready,
careless smile won friendship easily. On occasion
that smile could be a bit supercilious. Bert’s countenance
was normally rather grave, although if one
looked closely there was generally a glint of laughter
lurking in the brown eyes. It was a friendly
countenance, but not an ardent one. Bert’s smile
was slow to appear, but it was very genuine and
was usually followed by a rather infectious laugh.</p>

<p>Before Chick’s footfalls had entirely died away
beyond the closed door that smile had faded to an
expression of uneasiness. Bert had joked about
Mooney’s and the frequenters of Mooney’s, about
the cigarettes and the ten o’clock bed hour, but
those things were really threatening to cause him
some concern. Chick was different this fall, he reflected
now, jabbing tiny holes in a blotter with the
sharp point of the pencil. Perhaps being a senior
made you that way. Football, which had been an
all-absorbing interest to Chick last year and the
year before that, now seemed to have small appeal
for him. Of course, Chick had felt badly about
missing the captaincy last winter; had, in conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
with Bert, been rather bitter about it;
but this present careless, don’t-give-a-whoop attitude
toward the team and his job on it was unexpected.
Last year, for instance, Chick wouldn’t
have smoked a cigarette during the season if some
one had offered him cigarette, match and a thousand
dollars! Nor would he have protested
against the ten o’clock bed rule. And—Bert
shook his head at this reflection—he wouldn’t
have played as listlessly as he had played this
afternoon. To Bert, who had been trying two
seasons for a position on the team, the honor of
being selected from among some four hundred
fellows to represent Alton Academy on the football
field was something to work for and make
sacrifices for and, if won, to be mighty proud of!</p>

<p>Perhaps Chick was too sure of his position, Bert
reflected. Last year he had played a rather remarkable
game toward the latter part of the
season and had been largely instrumental in securing
the lone touchdown which, with a field-goal by
Nip Storer, one of the half-backs, represented
Alton’s earnings in the disastrous Kenly Hall
contest. Chick had been wonderful on defense
and had spoiled more than one Kenly dash in the
direction of the Alton line. On attack he had performed
his share, too, for it was his catch of a long
forward-pass that had made it possible for Jim
Galvin, substituting for the first-string full-back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
in the second quarter, to smash his way across the
Cherry-and-Black’s line. Chick had been a fine
and gallant warrior that day, and Bert warmed
toward him at the recollection until his present
shortcomings seemed of no importance. It had
been Chick, too, who had swooped down on a loose
ball in the last few minutes of the game and raced
off up the long field, dodging, side-stepping, twirling,
to the enemy’s twelve yards before he was
pulled down from behind. That Alton had failed
lamentably to gain a foot on the next four plays
detracted not at all from Chick’s heartening performance.
Indeed, that brief threat had somehow
made the pill of defeat less bitter to the Gray-and-Gold
that drizzling November evening. Kenly
Hall had won that contest by 16 to 9 with a team
that was a better all-around eleven than Alton’s.
The latter had shown fine moments, feats of brilliance,
daring plays, but Kenly had been steady,
machine-like, irresistible, and the victory had been
hers deservedly. Bert brought his thoughts back
from that thrilling battle, in which he had taken
part for just three minutes and forty seconds at
the tag-end, thereby winning the privilege of wearing
the “Big Gold A,” and resolutely drew his
book toward him. Mr. Hulman, the mathematics
instructor, was a new member of the faculty, and
seemed set on emulating the new broom and sweeping
clean. Bert laid his pencil aside, placed elbows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
on desk and hands against cheeks and set out to
discover what it was all about.</p>

<p>After a while the pencil came into play again,
and still later Bert closed the book with a sigh of
relief, pushed it away from him and glanced at his
watch. It was only a few minutes after eight!
There was still time to pick up some fellow along
the corridor and get to the movie theater for the
big picture, but after a tentative start toward the
closet to get his cap he shook his head and sank
into an easy chair. Saturday evening was no time
to find an agreeable companion. All the fellows
save those Bert didn’t desire as companions would
be out. He decided to write a letter home instead,
performing a task usually done on Sunday. He
began to think what he would write, and that was
fatal, for half an hour later he was still in the
chair, his thoughts a long way from the letter.
In the end, he found a book which he had started
to read away back in August, undressed, went to
bed and read. He was still reading when Chick
returned.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Bert, “what time is it?”</p>

<p>Chick frowned. “For the love of Pete, cut that
out,” he protested. “Honest, Bert, you’re getting
to be an awful nagger!”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said Bert. “I asked only because I’ve
been reading and haven’t any idea what time of
night it is.” He sat up and looked at the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
clock on the nearer chiffonier. It was four minutes
past ten according to the clock, but as the latter
was frequently wrong he didn’t accept the evidence
as conclusive. He laid back again, yawned,
dropped the book to the floor and clasped his hands
under his head. Chick, undressing, whistled cheerfully;
almost too cheerfully Bert thought. “Have
a good game?” the latter asked presently.</p>

<p>“Corking. I certainly made the old balls do
tricks to-night. Played three games of fifty points
and won two of them. Had to go some to get the
last one, though. That’s why I’m sort of late.”</p>

<p>“Who did you play with?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“Fellow named Devore.”</p>

<p>“Devore? Guess I don’t know him. Not in
school, is he?”</p>

<p>“No, he’s a guy lives in town. Works with the
railroad, I think. Pretty decent sort and a clever
lad with a cue. If I hadn’t been going mighty well
to-night I wouldn’t have got a game, I guess.
Gosh, that place was crowded, Bert!”</p>

<p>“Rooney’s?”</p>

<p>“No, Mooney’s, you coot!” Chick disappeared
into the corridor in slippers and dressing-gown.
Bert stared at the ceiling a moment and then got
out of bed and consulted his watch. The little
clock for once was right to a minute. When Chick
returned from the lavatory Bert was apparently
asleep and Chick turned out the light and got into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
bed. Silence reigned for a minute or two. Then
Chick asked softly: “Asleep, Bert?”</p>

<p>“No, are you?”</p>

<p>“Sure! No, listen. Who do you suppose I met
over on Meadow street, coming home?”</p>

<p>“Prince of Wales?”</p>

<p>“No; Johnny.”</p>

<p>After a moment Bert asked: “Did he see you?”</p>

<p>“Of course he did,” replied the other impatiently.
“Didn’t I say I met him? Ran right into
him, almost, in front of that laundry over there.”</p>

<p>“Did he say anything?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but ‘Ah, Burton!’ or something like
that.”</p>

<p>“What time was it, Chick?”</p>

<p>“Ten, or nearly. The clock struck when I got
to West street. Talk about rotten luck! Why the
dickens he was prowling around over there at that
time of night, goodness only knows! If he had
stopped I’d have given him a stall, but he just said
‘Ah, Burton’ in a kind of a funny tone and kept
right on. I think he had something in his hand;
a bag, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s going home over Sunday. There’s
a train about ten-twenty, I think.”</p>

<p>“That’s so.” Silence fell again in Number 21
and continued for several minutes. Then Chick’s
voice came once more. “Sort of wish I hadn’t run
into him, Bert.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Me and you both,” agreed Bert.</p>

<p>“Of course it’s blamed poppycock, that ten
o’clock bed rule, but he’s acting kind of snorty this
fall and he may get on his ear about it. If he does,
by gosh, I’ll tell him I’m no kid freshman to have
to go to bed with the chickens!”</p>

<p>“Sure! That will make it all right with him,”
answered Bert. “He will like that, Chick.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, hang it, a fellow’s got to have some
fun! What’s the good of going to bed at ten, anyway?
You don’t get to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Not if you keep on talking,” said Bert, yawning.</p>

<p>“Gosh,” grumbled the other, “you could go to
sleep at seven, I guess. How long have you been
in bed?”</p>

<p>“Couple of hours.”</p>

<p>“What, didn’t you go out at all?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—I mean no! Say, for Pete’s sake,
Chick, shut up and go to sleep! How do you
think I’m going to keep my schoolgirl complexion
if you go on jabbering?”</p>

<p>“All right. But, just the same, I wish I’d come
home by State street!”</p>

<p>“Or started earlier,” murmured Bert.</p>

<p>Chick glared resentfully across through the
darkness but could think of no appropriate retort.
Then came unmistakable indications that his room-mate
was asleep.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>AN HUMBLE MEMBER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Chick—his full name, by the way, was Charles
Sumner Burton—concluded on Monday that Coach
Cade’s preoccupation in the matter of getting to
the station in time for his train Saturday night had
kept him from realizing the other’s offense. Of
course, being a trifle late into bed was no hanging
matter, but Johnny had been more than usually
strict during the ten days or so of school, and
Chick had no wish to be called down. Johnny was
mild-mannered and soft-spoken enough when
things went right, but when they didn’t he could
be decidedly caustic. He was about thirty years of
age, a short, solidly-built, broad-shouldered and
deep-chested man with the blackest of black hair
that reminded one of the bristles on a shoe-brush.
His countenance presented the not unusual contrast
of a smiling mouth and a fighting chin. Tradition
had it that some ten years before Johnny
Cade had been a very difficult man to stop when he
had the ball in his arms and his head down! Chick
believed it, and it was far from his plan to interpose
any sort of opposition between Johnny and
his desires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides, Chick liked Mr. Cade a whole lot. In
a way of speaking, Johnny had made a football
player of Chick during the last two years. Of
course Chick didn’t give all the credit to the coach;
he felt that he himself had contributed largely to
the result; but he did acknowledge a considerable
obligation and was correspondingly grateful.
Chick liked him for other reasons, too, which were
the reasons that swayed most of those who knew
Johnny. The coach was acknowledgedly square,
quite as prompt and generous with praise as with
blame; if he worked his charges hard, he set the
pace himself; he was easy of approach, liked a
joke and never took advantage of his authority,
which was that of a faculty member. In short, he
was, in school parlance, a “white man.” He had
been in charge of the Alton teams for a number of
years and had turned out winning elevens in most
of them. There was a rumor current this fall to
the effect that the end of the present season would
likewise be the end of Johnny’s coaching career,
but the report lacked official confirmation and the
School hoped it wasn’t correct.</p>

<p>That Monday afternoon was largely given over
to the first principles of football, which was one
way of informing those who had taken part in the
Southport game that their labors had not been
wholly satisfactory. About sixty fellows had reported
since the beginning of the term and these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
were divided into three squads at present: Squad
A, which consisted of nineteen players who had
served on the First Team last year; Squad B,
which contained the members of the former Second
Eleven and a few fellows who had shown promise
on the various scrub teams, and Squad C, composed
of those whose ambition excelled their experience
and a half-dozen or so who had entered
school this fall and who were as yet unknown quantities.
But to-day, whether you were a Squad A
or a Squad C man, you tackled the dummy until
you were thoroughly covered, even impregnated,
with the still-damp loam of the pit, passed and
caught and fell on the ball in the most rudimentary
manner and, if you happened to be a candidate
for a line position, duck-waddled and, with your
head and shoulders thrust into the charging
harness, did your best to drag two restraining
youths with you over the slippery turf. If you
happened to have to set your heart on holding
down a backfield position you were spared the
harness but worked just as hard at starting and at
various other tasks cunningly devised to teach
celerity, accuracy and the rest of the football virtues.</p>

<p>There are always those who resent what, in class
room, would be termed review work. To a fellow
who had played against Kenly Hall for two seasons,
being returned to the drudgery of kindergarten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
stuff was a ridiculous imposition in the
judgment of several of the Squad A members.
Chick was among those who resented the imposition,
but he showed his resentment less than most
of the others. He had a hunch that it might be
just as well not to court the limelight this afternoon,
that if he could survive practice without coming
to the notice of the coach he would not be likely
to awaken memories, memories dating back to Saturday
night at some four minutes to ten o’clock!
So Chick, albeit his soul revolted, ground his face
into the dirt and filled his ears with it at tackling
practice and maintained a cheerful countenance,
abstaining, even when at the end of the waiting
line farthest from Mr. Cade, from joining in the
grumbles and sarcasms delivered in guarded
tones.</p>

<p>To an unbiased onlooker it might have appeared
that the smiling, shock-haired man in the faded
and torn sweater and the old khaki trousers had
some reason for trundling the stuffed effigy along
the wire for the benefit of Squad A, because, after
all, quite a few members of that coterie performed
extremely poorly at the task of wrapping their
arms about the dummy and dragging it to earth,
and not much better at throwing their bodies in
front of it in blocking. In fact, those who appeared
to have really mastered these sciences were
to be counted on the fingers of two hands, omitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the thumbs! Even Captain Jonas Lowe, who, with
Andy Dozier, left tackle, towered inches above all
the others and looked the perfect football lineman,
failed to win commendation to-day; a fact
which aided Chick considerably to endure the indignity
put upon him. Chick had not yet forgiven
Jonas for winning the captaincy over his head,
something which, of course, Jonas wasn’t in the
least to blame for, although if you had charged
Chick with harboring resentment at this late day
he would have denied the allegation indignantly.
He would probably have felt rather insulted. Certainly
he would have reminded you that he had
himself put the motion to make Jonas’s election
unanimous, and he would have pointed out that he
and the new captain were the best of friends. The
latter assertion would, however, have been only
negatively true. That is to say, he and Jonas
were friends merely to the extent of never being
unfriendly, which constitutes a relationship somewhat
different from that implied by Chick.
Whether Jonas realized that Chick still begrudged
him the leadership of the team, would have been
hard to say, but it was perfectly apparent that if
he did realize it he was not in the least troubled
about it. There was something rather Jovian
about the big, cumbersome, placid Jonas. You got
the impression of one gazing calmly down from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Olympus, untroubled by petty mortals and their
affairs.</p>

<p>Of those who did win a word of praise from
Johnny Cade this afternoon one was Bert Hollins.
There were quite a few things in the line of football
essentials that Bert was good at, and tackling,
whether of the dummy or a hard-running enemy,
was one of them. Bert’s relation to the team was
somewhat peculiar. Last season, after trying very
hard to make the Second until well into October,
he had succeeded only in getting hurt in his third
scrimmage. He had attended practice with a
crutch under his left arm for a week and watched
it from the bench for nearly a week more. Then,
almost before he had limbered that injured knee up
again, there had come a demand from the First for
a light, fast backfield man and Mr. McFadden,
coach of the Scrubs, had sent Bert across on approval.
That had been a big moment in the boy’s
life, that sudden elevation to the First Team, and
he had tried desperately hard to make good. In
a manner he had succeeded, for he had shown about
everything except weight and experience. One
without the other might have served, but together
they kept him in the background. He played in
two of the late-season contests and won good
words, and, as a reward, was sent in by the coach
near the end of the big game to earn his letter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
There had been no opportunity for a signal display
of brilliancy. He had not seized the ball and
dashed sixty or seventy or eighty yards down the
field for a touchdown and consequent victory.</p>

<p>None of the thrilling, dramatic feats which story
tellers love to relate, and which sometimes really
are performed, fell to his portion. As a matter
of unromantic fact, he had the ball but once and
lost better than two yards in an ill-advised attempt
to knife through inside tackle. Better men than he
had repeatedly failed at that play already. He
emerged from that fray with no more glory than
he had entered, but he had at least emerged a
full-fledged member of the Alton Academy Football
Team, with the right to wear a big golden-yellow
A on his gray sweater, a tiny yellow football
on his cap and a gray-gold-gray ribbon on his
straw hat in summer. There were other privileges
and benefits, too, although of secondary importance.
For instance, he could reserve four seats
in the center of the stand for the Kenly games,
he could cast a vote in the election of captain—a
prerogative he had subsequently exercised—and
his countenance, together with some thirty other
countenances, would grace the wall of the gymnasium
for posterity to gaze upon with awe—or
boredom.</p>

<p>Bert was mighty proud of his membership, but
his satisfaction was dulled by the suspicion that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
he didn’t really deserve the honor. There were
fellows—he could think of half a dozen, perhaps—who
played better football than he did and who
had not won the coveted A. In short, Bert secretly
looked on himself as a Letter Man in name only!
But he meant to correct all that. This fall he was
going to deserve the prize he had won. He was
going to try so blamed hard that success simply
wouldn’t be able to escape him! He had added
several pounds since last winter and at least an
inch of height, and he had handled a football nearly
every day during the summer, generously obeying
Mr. Cade’s injunction to the members of the squad.
If all the milk he had drunk and all the eggs he
had eaten could have been mixed together the result
would have been an omelet as big as—well, I
don’t know how big. But I do know that in August
Bert’s mother had to call the family physician in
to advise a bilious boy to omit eggs from his diet
for the rest of the summer. Perhaps what had
kept Bert from attaining the height of Captain
Jonas and the rotundity of Lum Patten by the
middle of September was the fact that when he
wasn’t throwing or kicking a football around he
was playing tennis or swimming.</p>

<p>No matter how he figured it, Bert couldn’t make
himself out better than a third-choice substitute
half-back. Storer, Ness, Savell, Keys and Tyron
were the mainstays, and then there were at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
three other backfield candidates who, in Bert’s
estimation at least, were held in higher esteem than
he. And goodness only knew who else might suddenly
spring into the spot-light before the season
was over! Well, if hard work and the most determined
efforts would avail he meant to land considerably
nearer the head of the list than he was
now. What he feared more than all else was a
repetition of last fall’s catastrophe. He was light
and so subject to rude handling, and last season’s
experience had proved how surprisingly easy it
was to get hurt. Why, he had merely stumbled
over some fellow’s legs and been out of the game
for almost a fortnight with a wrenched knee!
Even as late as early summer the silly thing had
twinged him occasionally, although he had been
careful not to mention the fact. He believed it to
be as good as ever now, but he was haunted by the
fear that it might not be, that he would hurt it
again and be laid off. Being laid off was a fatal
thing sometimes. Like time and tide, football seasons
wait for no one, and more than one poor fellow
on the injured list has watched a hale substitute
run off with his position under his very eyes.
Fear of another injury to that left knee or to
some other portion of his anatomy was threatening
to become an obsession, although he didn’t
realize it.</p>

<p>Going back to Upton after practice was over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Bert asked Chick whether Coach Cade had said
anything about Saturday night. Chick laughed.
“Not a word, old scout. Know what I think?
Well, I think he was so taken up with getting that
train that he forgot all about seeing me. Anyway,
he didn’t say a word to-day. Didn’t even
look cross-eyed at me!”</p>

<p>“That’s luck,” said Bert. “Take my advice,
Chick, and don’t get caught again.”</p>

<p>“Not going to, believe me. Another time I’ll
come home by River street, even if it is longer.
It’s a safe bet Johnny doesn’t wander around over
there!”</p>

<p>“Maybe not, but the safest thing is to be in the
dormitory by nine-thirty, and that’s your play
from now on. You can’t be quite certain about
Johnny. Maybe he’s forgotten about meeting you
the other night and maybe he hasn’t. I wouldn’t
want to bet either way, Chick.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, he’s got too many other things to
worry about, I guess. Say, he had an awful cheek
to work A Squad the way he did to-day. Regular
beginners’ stuff! Gosh, I’ve got more dirt in my
hair than I’ll be able to get out in a dozen shampoos.
Funny thing was, though,” added Chick as
they started upstairs, “that we tackled the dummy
like a lot of pups!”</p>

<p>“The tackling in the Southport game was pretty
rotten,” said Bert. “I don’t believe there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
more than two clean tackles made by our gang,
Chick.”</p>

<p>“And I made them both?” laughed Chick.
“Thanks!”</p>

<p>“You did not! You were as bad as any of them.
Pete Ness made one corking tackle the time he
got that Southport guy over by the side-line, and
I think it was Billy Haines made the other. Generally
we just sort of tagged the other fellow on the
shoulder and let him by!”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got to be polite to your guests,”
replied Chick, grinning. “I did miss my tackles
pretty awfully, though, and I know it as well as
you do, old scout. Fact is, Bert, I haven’t been
playing my real game yet. I guess it takes a fellow
a week or so to get back into harness, eh? Oh,
by the way, I told Coles we’d be around to see him
this evening. He’s got some apples his folks sent
him from New Hampshire or somewhere and he
wants them eaten up before they go bad. He says
the training table starts Wednesday evening,
Bert.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if I’ll get on it.”</p>

<p>“Sure! Why not? At that, though, you’ll be
lucky if you don’t. You get beastly tired of the
grub after about a month of it.”</p>

<p>“I saw Mr. McFadden at the field to-day,” said
Bert. “I guess they’ll be starting the Scrub Team
pretty soon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“Next week, probably. Good thing, too, for the
place is all littered up over there now.”</p>

<p>“I hope it doesn’t occur to Johnny to put me
back where he got me,” Bert observed ruefully.
“I dare say fellows do get dropped to the Second
sometimes, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t think you need to worry about
that. You’ll get along all right, Bert. I have a
hunch that Johnny’s going in for a fast backfield
this year, and when it comes to speed you’ve got
it all over some of the chaps. It was that lot of
heavy, slow backs that spilled the beans for us last
year, if you make inquiry of me. Things went a
heap better in the last quarter, after some of those
truck horses had quit!”</p>

<p>“I’d hate to go back to the Second,” mused
Bert.</p>

<p>“Gosh, you can find more things to worry
about!” laughed the other. “Last week you were
afraid you were going to break a leg or something.
You’re the original calamity howler,
Bert!”</p>

<p>Bert smiled. “I suppose it’s because I want so
hard to make good this year, Chick,” he answered
apologetically.</p>

<p>“You’re going to, old scout, so buck up. Not
that you’ve any right to expect it, either. Most
fellows don’t get a position nailed down until their
senior year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“You did. And so did Lowe.”</p>

<p>“Exceptions proving the rule, Bert. As for
Jonas, I’ll say he played in a good deal of luck
last fall. If Peabody hadn’t gone bad on account
of studies and getting all worked up over the way
Mac and the rest of the Faculty nagged him there
for a while Jonas would still be a sub, I’ll bet.
Mind you, Bert, I’m not saying he isn’t a good
player when he gets started, but no one would have
discovered it if Dick had held his job. Why, up to
the Lorimer game or after Jonas was kicking his
heels on the bench more times than he was playing!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess there was some luck in that,”
acknowledged Bert. “But Jonas certainly filled
Peabody’s place mighty nicely after he got it.
Who’s going to make left end position this fall,
Chick?”</p>

<p>“Left end? Why, I guess Joe Tate’s pretty certain
of it. Just as certain as I am of right end.”
Chick’s laugh suggested that there wasn’t much
doubt in his mind about that!</p>

<p>“Kruger was awfully good Saturday for the
little while he played,” said Bert.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dutch is good, too. One of the best. But
I guess Joe’s got it cinched. Where you’re going
to see some surprises, though, before Johnny has
knocked the outfit into shape is between Joe and
center. Meecham won’t last at guard and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
wouldn’t give an awful lot for Andy Dozier’s
chance at tackle. Unless I miss my guess Nat
Wick will have Meecham out of there inside of a
fortnight.”</p>

<p>“But Dozier’s a crackajack, Chick! Why, last
year—”</p>

<p>“All right, but what happened in the Kenly
game? They ripped him to pieces in just about
twenty minutes, didn’t they?”</p>

<p>“I heard he was sick. Some one said he was up
in Patten’s room for an hour that morning and
Lum and two or three others were dosing him
with everything from hair oil to Seidlitz powders!
I remember myself that he looked like the dickens
just before lunch.”</p>

<p>“Funk, probably. I’ve seen fellows worse than
he was before a big game. They get over it by the
time to start. Gosh, I’ve been sort of teetery
myself!”</p>

<p>“You! Bet it was something you’d eaten then,”
jeered Bert. “You’ve got about as much—as
much whatever it is as a goat!”</p>

<p>“Is that so? I’ll have you understand that I’m
a man of very delicate—er—susceptibilities.
Highly strung, nervous, you know. Temperamental!
That’s the old word I wanted.”</p>

<p>“Put your coat on and let’s get over to supper,”
said Bert. “You’re saying things that don’t mean
anything!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>THE MANAGER GIVES A PARTY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Coles Wistar’s room in Lykes, which he shared
with Ted Ball, First Team quarter-back, looked
full to capacity when Chick and Bert arrived there
that Monday evening. Once inside, however, accommodations
of a sort could be discerned, and
Chick crowded onto a bed and Bert squeezed in between
Anstruther and Tommy Parish on the window-seat.
Coles Wistar was Football Manager,
and it was largely a football crowd which was
present. There were George Anstruther, familiarly
“Judge,” and Billy Pillsbury, assistant managers,
Ted Ball, Hank Howard, Pete Ness, Jim
Galvin and Nip Storer, all of the Team. Tommy
Parish was present because Pill had brought him
and no one had yet thrown him out. Homer Johnson,
who roomed with Captain Lowe, had brought
Jonas’s regrets and remained to partake of hospitality.
These, with the host, Chick and Bert,
formed the party, a round dozen in all.</p>

<p>Lykes Hall, reserved for the Senior Class Students,
held fewer rooms than the other dormitories,
but, fortunately for Coles’ party, they were
larger than the rooms in Haylow or Upton or Borden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the latter the Freshman domicile. Number 5
was well-furnished and attractive, for Coles had
excellent taste in such matters. There was a refreshing
lack of school and college pennants on
the walls, this style of decoration being represented
by a single Alton banner hung above the
double windows. There were a good many pictures,
most of them etchings, of which Coles was
a modest collector, a few framed photographs and
one lone trophy on the walls. The latter, placed
above a closet door, was a wooden panel some
three feet long with a black, sanded background
against which gilt letters startlingly announced
“EASTBOUND TRAINS.” It was a memento
of Ted Ball’s unregenerate freshman days, and
although it had always grated against Coles’ artistic
sensibilities he had never been able to persuade
Ted to remove it. Ted acknowledged that it
might be a jarring note in the decorative scheme,
but he had annexed that trophy under extremely
difficult circumstances, braving arrest and, possibly,
penal servitude, and, although nowadays
self-condemnatory in his explanation of its presence
here, he was secretly very proud of it. Ted
was a rather stocky, bright-eyed chap of eighteen,
fun-loving and extremely popular at Alton. He
was equally brilliant at studies and as a quarter-back,
a shining example to his team-mates which,
unfortunately, not many emulated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The particular host of the evening, Coles Wistar,
was unlike his room-mate in many ways.
Coles was tall, with a thin face and lightish hair,
wore glasses and looked intellectual. He had spent
a year at a junior preparatory school near Boston
before coming to Alton and had managed to acquire
the broad A and a Bostonese accent. You
could always make a hit with Coles by inferring
that he came from the Hub, although as matter
of fact, he lived in a small village in New Hampshire.
In spite of one or two trifling affectations
he was no fool and was an unusually capable manager.
Conversation, interrupted by the arrival
of Chick and Bert, gathered momentum again.
Tommy Parish, it appeared, had, in the terse
phraseology of Hank Howard, been “shooting off
his mouth again.”</p>

<p>“Says the Team’s the rottenest he’s seen
since he came here,” explained Hank to Chick.
“The silly ass doesn’t know a thing about football,
anyway, but you’d think, to hear him go
on—”</p>

<p>“Pshaw,” began Chick, “why pay attention to
that coot? He just likes to hear himself—” But
Tommy, even in the midst of Coles’ scathing rejoinder,
overheard and challenged Hank’s assertion.</p>

<p>“All wrong, Howard. I know a heap more about
football than most of you guys who play it, or try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to. Why wouldn’t I? All you fellows learn is
how to look after your own positions. You’re on
the inside looking cross-eyes at your own jobs.
I’m on the outside looking in at the whole works.
Now let me—”</p>

<p>“Muzzle him, somebody,” said Nip Storer.</p>

<p>“Tie a can to him,” advised Jim Galvin.</p>

<p>“Let the silly ass talk,” laughed Ted Ball. “Go
on and tell ’em, Tommy.”</p>

<p>“Sure.” Tommy looked entirely composed,
quite unaffected by hostility. Any one well acquainted
with him—Pill, for instance—would have
known that he was having a thoroughly good time.
“Sure I’ll tell them. Howard says I don’t know
anything about football. All right. I say I know
more about it than he does.”</p>

<p>“Quit your kidding,” growled Hank.</p>

<p>“He may know more or less about playing
tackle, but I’ll bet he can’t answer three questions
I can put to him.”</p>

<p>“What sort of questions?” demanded Hank
suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Questions on football. Questions covered by
the rules which you’re all supposed to know from
A to Z, whether you’re a tackle or an end or a
back.”</p>

<p>“Heck, I don’t pretend to have all the rules at
my finger ends,” protested Hank. “There are too
many of them!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shoot ’em, Tommy,” said Jim Galvin. “Go
on, kid.”</p>

<p>“All right, but these are for Howard, mind.
The rest of you keep out. First, your side kicks,
Howard. You are on-side. The opponent prepares
for a fair catch. You are nearer the ball
than he is. What would happen if you made the
catch?”</p>

<p>“I’d get socked ten or fifteen yards, of course,”
answered Hank, “for interfering with a free
catch.” He spoke doubtfully, though, suspecting
a snag.</p>

<p>“Hold on,” exclaimed Nip eagerly. “You said
he was on-side!”</p>

<p>“Keep out, you!” Tommy warned. There were
chuckles from some of the others and Hank looked
harassed.</p>

<p>“How could I be on-side, I’d like to know?
Even if I was—”</p>

<p>“Second question,” interrupted Tommy. “Your
side has the ball ten yards from the opponent’s
goal line and on the fourth down makes a forward
pass over the line. You receive the pass. You
stand with one foot on the end line, but the ball
reaches you a yard inside the zone and you complete
the pass. What about it?”</p>

<p>Hank looked about for aid, but met only grinning
countenances. “The ball came down <em>inside</em> the
zone?” he asked cautiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“A yard inside. You have to reach well out for
it.”</p>

<p>“If I catch it it’s all right,” said Hank. “You
said I had my foot <em>on</em> the end line, not <em>over</em> it.
Anyway, if the ball was inside—”</p>

<p>Ted’s chuckle unsettled him, and he scowled his
annoyance. “Hang it, I didn’t say I could answer
all the catch questions you could think of! Just
the same, I’ll bet I’m right about that. Ain’t I,
Ted?”</p>

<p>“Third question,” said Tommy inexorably.</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up! Answer your own fool questions!”</p>

<p>“Behave, Hank!” admonished Coles. “Put the
question, Tommy.”</p>

<p>“You’re captain of your team, Howard, and the
other side has the ball between your fifteen and
sixteen yards. One of your side is caught holding
and the umpire penalizes you fifteen yards.
What would you do?”</p>

<p>“What down was it?” asked Hank, mazed. “I
mean, who had the ball?”</p>

<p>“The opponent, on your fifteen and a half. One
of your gang is caught holding in the line and the
ump socks you the penalty and puts the ball forward
fifteen yards from where it was put in play.
You’re captain of your team. Get it?”</p>

<p>“Sure, but what can I do? The ball still belongs
to the other fellow, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Several of the listeners were exchanging puzzled
glances, while Hank’s forehead was a network of
wrinkles. Of the dozen there only Tommy and
Bert appeared serene, Tommy owlishly regarding
his victim, Bert leaning back against the window-sill
wearing a faintly amused expression. “That
your answer?” inquired Tommy.</p>

<p>“Gosh, I don’t understand what you’re getting
at,” fumed Hank. “If my side had the ball, all
right, but you say it hasn’t. What would you expect
me to do, anyhow? Sass the umpire?”</p>

<p>“Look here, Tommy,” broke in Jim Galvin, “I
don’t get that any more than Hank does. What’s
the answer?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you in a sec. First, how many of the
questions did Howard answer correctly?”</p>

<p>“None, so far,” said Jim. “He doesn’t seem to
have answered the last one at all yet.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” Hank protested. “What was
wrong with the first answer? He asked—”</p>

<p>“You could have caught the ball yourself, Hank,
if you were on-side,” said Ted. “Shut up a second.
What’s the catch in the last one, Tommy?”</p>

<p>“Why,” Tommy replied sweetly, “if I’d been
captain instead of Hank I’d have protested the
placing of the ball half a yard from the goal line!”</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s right!” exclaimed Chick. “It
ought to have gone to the one-yard line! Isn’t that
right, Tommy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Right as rain, old dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thunder,” growled Hank disgustedly, “no
one’s expected to know all the kinks! And, look
here, you fellows, what was wrong with that one
about the forward-pass into the end zone? I was
inside and the ball was inside and I made the catch.
I’ll bet I answered that one right!”</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t, Hank,” laughed Ted. “Tommy
said you had one foot on the line. Rules say you
mustn’t do it, see? On or over, either one, queers
you, Hank.”</p>

<p>“That’s crazy! I’ll bet the rest of you didn’t
know it, either! Gee, I’d like to ask you guys a
few!”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” advised Pill. “Show ’em up,
Hank.”</p>

<p>Hank looked grim for a moment, and it was
plainly to be seen that he was doing some hard
thinking. Then, as expectant silence prolonged
itself, a slow grin overspread his face and he shook
his head. “No use,” he said, chuckling. “I can’t
think of any!”</p>

<p>“Well, it looks to me as though Tommy had won
his point,” said Anstruther. “So it behooves us
to listen respectfully to his pleasant criticisms of
the Team. Go ahead, Tommy, and say your
piece.”</p>

<p>Tommy shrugged. “I’ve said it. I said this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
year’s team was the punkest I’ve seen here, and
I say it again.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve seen quite a few,” remarked
Chick, with a wink at Bert. “How many years
have you been here now, anyway, Tommy? This
your fourth or fifth?”</p>

<p>“Third,” replied Tommy untroubledly amidst
the laughter. “I saw last year’s team and the
team before that, and I’m seeing this thing you’ve
got here now, and I say it ain’t so good, fellows.
Mind you, I’m saying this for your benefit, not
because I want to crab.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you never crab, Tommy!” said Pill.</p>

<p>“What,” asked Coles in a patient voice, “strikes
you as being the principal—ah—weakness?”</p>

<p>“The players,” replied Tommy promptly, and
allowed himself a wicked grin.</p>

<p>A howl of derision went up. Then Coles inquired
with a pretense of vast respect: “Are they
all rotten, Tommy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, there are three or four that look pretty
good.”</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” cried Ted. “We’ve got
something to build on!”</p>

<p>Chick, however, demanded
scoffingly: “Say, for the love of Pete, who
gave you any license to set yourself up as a critic,
Tommy? You’re nothing but a fat loafer, and you
know it. Cramming the football rules doesn’t
make you a judge of the game, youngster.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps it was the reference to a tendency toward
obesity that got under Tommy’s skin. In
any case, his cheerful calm vanished and he answered
warmly: “If I’m fat, Burton, it’s not in my
head! And it doesn’t take a critic to see what
a rotten game you’re playing, either!”</p>

<p>“Lay off that stuff, Tommy!” ordered Coles
severely.</p>

<p>“So I’m fat-headed am I?” demanded Chick,
reddening. “Say, you blamed little fat rotter—”
He thrust himself off the bed and took a step toward
the window-seat, but Ted interposed.</p>

<p>“Calm yourself, Chick. Tommy doesn’t count.
Besides, he didn’t mean what he said, did you, you
crazy ape?”</p>

<p>“Sure, I did,” responded Tommy, once more
master of his emotions. “He <em>has</em> got a swelled
head and he <em>is</em> playing rotten.”</p>

<p>“If you can’t act like a gentleman—” began
Coles angrily.</p>

<p>“Oh, put him out,” called Nip Storer.</p>

<p>Chick, held in subjection by Ted’s capable hand—it’s
difficult to get to your feet when some one
is pushing against your chest—glared wrathfully
at Tommy. Tommy returned his gaze without a
qualm. After all, reflected Bert, beside him, he
didn’t lack courage!</p>

<p>“I really think you’d better beat it, Tommy,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
advised Ted coldly. “You are a pesky nuisance,
anyway, and I don’t know who let you in.”</p>

<p>“Then he goes, too,” said Tommy, nodding at
the irate Chick. “He hadn’t any call to say I was
fat!”</p>

<p>“So you are,” declared Chick hotly. “You’re
a fat fool!”</p>

<p>“Move both members be allowed to withdraw,”
said Jim Galvin, grinning enjoyably.</p>

<p>“Seconded,” said Anstruther. “The secretary
is directed to expunge the remarks of both gentlemen—I
mean rough-necks—from the records.”</p>

<p>“Forget it, you two,” advised Ted. “Mutual
apologies are in order. How about it, Tommy? If
you want to stay, son, you’d better behave.”</p>

<p>“Do we get the apples?” asked Tommy soberly.</p>

<p>“Sure,” Ted answered amidst laughter.</p>

<p>“I apologize,” said Tommy. “Just the
same—” But Bert’s elbow colliding with his ribs
interrupted his qualifying addenda.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Chick, restored to better
humor. “He isn’t fat. He’s merely plump.”</p>

<p>Tommy looked doubtful for a moment, but Coles
pulled a box of apples from under a bed and the
doubt vanished. During the subsequent half-hour
Tommy was much too busy to indulge in what he
termed constructive criticism. No one counted
the number of Northern Spies he demolished, but
it was considerable. Conversation proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
briskly but somewhat unintelligibly. In the middle
of the feast “Dutch” Kruger arrived, bearing a
fat black case, and was hailed tumultuously. He
devoured two apples hastily, urged on by impatient
watchers, and would have started a third. But
Jim Galvin deftly took the apple away from him
and substituted the black case. Dutch’s protests
were drowned. Good-naturedly he produced a
shining saxophone.</p>

<p>“‘Football Blues,’ Dutch!”</p>

<p>“Aye! Attaboy, Dutch! I want to sing!”</p>

<p>“What time is it?” asked Dutch anxiously.</p>

<p>“Only nine. Lots of time, boy. Give us ‘The
Football Blues.’”</p>

<p>Dutch grinned, nestled the mouthpiece against
his lips and blew. At the same time he began to
pat the floor with his feet and sway from his hips.
The saxophone nodded and curveted. Most of the
assemblage broke into song, tapping the floor, too,
swaying as Dutch swayed. Tommy, a large red
apple in one hand, his eyes staring fixedly, hypnotically
at the musician, heaved his plump shoulders
ludicrously. <a href="#image02">From across the hall came an
agonized wail of “<em>Cut that out!</em>”</a> which, however,
failed to make itself heard in Number 5. Up and
down the corridor doors were set open and in more
than one room a toiler at his books gave over toiling
for the while and pursed his lips.</p>

<p>The thing was a composition of Dutch’s own,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
words and music, and if the rimes wouldn’t
always bear inspection the tune was enough to
make you lenient. “The Football Blues” had
made Dutch famous throughout the school and he
was much in demand. There were many verses,
which recounted the experiences of an ambitious
youth essaying to play football, but it was the
chorus that made the hit. The saxophone wailed
and sobbed and yowled, Dutch’s eyes roamed from
floor to ceiling, ecstatically bright, and the crowd
roared lustily from bodies that swayed and shook.</p>

<p>They had to have all the verses, which were numerous,

played other melodies and the concert continued
until Coles warned that it was nine-thirty and,
grabbing another apple or two, the guests went
off. On the way to Upton, Chick, recalling his
grievance, observed disgustedly: “I don’t see why
Coles had to have that pesky nuisance there. He’s
the freshest kid in school. Gosh, some one ought
to turn him over and give him a good whaling!”</p>

<p>“Tommy Parish? Yes, he is trying. He seems
to love to start an argument and get every one
peeved. Funny chap.”</p>

<p>“Funny? He’s crazy! The next time he gets
fresh with me I’ll slap his pudgy face, no matter
where it is.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you’d always find it in about the
same place,” said Bert.</p>

<small>TOMMY MAKES A PREDICTION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Bert went to the training table with the more important
members of the squad on Wednesday, and,
contrary to expectation, Mr. McFadden, Second
Team coach, gathered his charges together on Friday
and started to whip them into shape. While
Bert had not actually feared being released to the
Scrub, he nevertheless experienced some relief
when Mr. McFadden began operations without
him. The removal of the Scrub players from the
big squad made quite a difference about the First
Team gridiron and practice on Friday seemed
more methodical. Bert had a long try-out at half-back
during the scrimmage and managed to show
speed and clean handling of the ball. But the
plays used against the first-string fellows were
not of the sort calculated to advantage a light back,
no matter how fast, and Bert had small success
when carrying the ball. Fitz Savell, who played
inside half, did much better, and after work was
over Bert tried in vain to believe that he had made
an impression on Coach Cade.</p>

<p>Saturday Banning High School came and presented
a light but snappy opposition. In the first
half the ball was seldom far out of Alton territory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
for Banning had developed a clever passing game
last season, by which she had scored twice on the
Gray-and-Gold, and hadn’t forgotten how to use
it this fall. She had, too, a punter who managed
to get some five yards more than Nip Storer, who
did the kicking in the first half, and as a result of
punts and passes Alton was placed on the defensive
early and kept there most of the time.
Banning failed to score, however, although a difference
of a few inches would have converted a
failure into a field-goal in the second period.</p>

<p>When the last half began Coach Cade used his
second-string players extensively; Kruger and
Thomas and Wick at the left of center, Tifton in
Captain Lowe’s place, Lovell at quarter, Savell
and Keys in the half-back positions. Since the
first-string men hadn’t been able to more than hold
the enemy in the first half, there were those among
the audience who censured the coach’s move. But
Johnny had his own notions, and he seldom bothered
about what the School thought of his methods.
Here was an enemy strong enough to offer real
opposition and yet of slight importance as a rival.
Usually the early season opponents were unable to
provide more than good practice for Alton; were,
of course, selected for that reason. But Banning,
partly because of having held over some seven or
eight of last fall’s players, was well advanced,
while Alton, for some reason not so easily determined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
was fully a week behind normal development,
and what had been looked on as an easy contest
had assumed the aspects of a real struggle.</p>

<p>Coach Cade might have worked his best players
through three periods and made victory more
probable, but he chose to risk defeat in order to
give the substitutes a taste of real battle. Since
all the first-choice men had played through to the
whistle in the first half, they could not be counted
on for later aid, and Johnny must needs place full
dependence on his lesser heroes. When the third
period started he still had Patten at center, Haines
at right tackle, Chick Burton at right end, Ted Ball
at quarter and Galvin at full-back, all members
of the Old Guard, but one by one they retired until
by the time the second half was five minutes along
second- and third-string players held all the positions.
Since Banning was still using or could call
on every man who had begun the battle, the odds
looked heavily in her favor. But the Alton substitutes
were old hands at the game and were not
to be dismayed by a high school team, especially a
team against which several of them had played last
year and defeated, and Bus Lovell, who had taken
Ted Ball’s place, set about his task with fire and
enthusiasm. After Banning had kicked off and
Larry Keys had run the ball back nearly twelve
yards, Bus began sending Couch back to punting
position and running his plays from that formation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Savell and Keys made good gains outside
the tackles and twice Couch tore off fair yardage
on wide runs. He was a heavy chap and hard to
stop, and usually added two or three strides to
his progress after he was tackled. Alton reached
the middle of the field without yielding the ball,
crossing the center-line finally on a forward pass
from Couch to Dutch Kruger that was good for
nine yards.</p>

<p>The stand cheered incessantly, wrought to quite
a pitch of excitement, and demanded a score. But
Keys fumbled a pass and Banning fell on the ball
on her forty-seven and the tide of battle flowed the
other way until Alton was back on her twenty-eight.
There she twice stopped Banning’s punches
at the line and knocked down a forward-pass.
Banning sent her place-kicker back to the thirty-nine
yards and, with what breeze there was blowing
straight from behind her, looked suddenly dangerous.
However, one fumble leads to another,
and the ball was never kicked. Whether the fault
was the Banning center’s or the quarter-back’s is
immaterial. The pigskin struck the ground before
the holder could get his hands on it. After that
it was juggled just long enough for Gus Thomas
to upset his opponent and arrive on the scene.
Thereupon the quarter-back did the sensible thing.
He laid himself flat and snuggled the ball to him
fondly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Thirty seconds later Lovell caught a punt on
his five-yard line and the Gray-and-Gold started
once more toward the distant goal.</p>

<p>If there was one man who stood out above the
others in the ensuing march it was Larry Keys,
playing right half-back. Only once did he fail
to gain when the ball was given to him. He had
weight and speed and a nice discrimination in the
matter of choosing his outlets. On a play from
kick formation in which two backs faked an attack
on the right of the line and Larry went outside
tackle on the left, with right tackle swinging out
and going ahead as interference, he twice made
advances of more than ten yards and netted
shorter distances until Banning solved the play
and stopped it. However, once inside the visitor’s
forty yards, Alton’s advance slowed and staggered,
and when two slams at the wings had failed
and a forward-pass had grounded, Couch punted
from the forty-six.</p>

<p>By that time the fourth quarter was well along
and Alton had the light wind behind her. The
Banning quarter misjudged the kick, touched the
ball without catching it and chased it back toward
the goal-line, closely pursued by Dutch Kruger.
Pigskin, quarter-back and Dutch arrived simultaneously
at the last streak of lime, and when the
whistle had blown Alton had scored two points on
a safety. The Gray-and-Gold cohorts cheered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and the game paused while the Banning captain
made an impassioned plea for a touchback. In the
end he was persuaded that the official’s verdict was
just and the battle waged again. That incident,
however, while it gave Alton a score, resulted disastrously
in the end. Banning, it seemed, needed
but that filip of hard-luck to start her going with
a new impetus. Three fresh players were hurried
in and Banning bounded away from her thirty-yard
line like a runner from his mark. She used
one or two new plays that puzzled the adversary
until the middle of the field was reached. There
a long forward-pass, almost successful, led Alton
to playing her backs deeper. Banning switched
promptly to short passes and gained her distance
on two such, making Alton’s thirty-eight yards.
Another overhead attempt grounded and Banning
tried the left end and got four on a wide run. Inside
the thirty-five-yard line she tried a sweep to
the left which, while it centered the ball, lost about
a yard. On fourth down she staged a placement
kick but didn’t carry it out. Full-back took the
pass and went through inside Hank Howard for
all but a foot of the required distance. After the
gain had been measured Alton was awarded the
pigskin.</p>

<p>With something less than two minutes left, the
stand breathed loudly with relief and Coach Cade
hustled an assortment of substitutes on. Among
these was an entire new backfield: Riding as quarter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Tyron and Parkhurst as halfs and Franklin as
full. Obeying instructions, Riding shot Tyron at
the Banning left tackle on first down and got two
yards. A second attempt, however, yielded nothing,
and Riding dropped back to his sixteen yards
to punt. Thus far Alton’s line had held against
all assaults of the enemy during like operations,
but this time Banning had her eyes on that goal
that loomed so close and put everything into a desperate
charge that tore a gaping hole in the right
of the Alton line. Riding received a pass that was
a bit too low, straightened, turned the ball and
started his swing. After that there was much
confusion, a confusion of seething forms about a
loose ball, for Riding had kicked the pigskin
squarely into the body of a charging enemy!</p>

<p>When the whistle blew a Banning player, the
undermost of a pile of several, had the ball, and
a bare two inches of its scarred surface overlapped
Alton’s five-yard line. In the stand some four
hundred youths stood and frenziedly implored
their warriors to “<em>Hold, Alton!</em>” But Banning
had tasted blood, had liked it and wanted more.
Two new linemen were sent galloping on, and
then, with less than sixty seconds of playing time
remaining, Banning High School took revenge for
several years of drubbing at the hands of Alton
Academy. It required the full four downs to put
that ball over, but over it went finally, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
timekeeper’s watch ticked off the last few seconds,
over on a last frenzied surge at the very center of
the Gray-and-Gold line from the two yards, with
the back who carried the pigskin hurtling his way
to victory over the shoulders of the defenders.
Little cared Banning that she missed the try-for-point.
She had won, 6 to 2. That was glory
enough!</p>

<p>The School was disappointed and showed the
fact. The applause that almost invariably greeted
the players as they sought their table in dining
hall was lacking this Saturday evening; or was so
faint it merely emphasized the absence of the customary
demonstration. The game caused a good
deal of discussion, and the consensus of opinion
was to the effect that the defeat had been unnecessary
and that Coach Cade had, in the popular
phraseology, pulled a boner. Of course there were
those who stood up for Johnny, and among them
was Tommy Parish. As always, Tommy’s views
met opposition, and, as always, that fact merely
spurred him to more brazen assertions. Tommy
had the misfortune—for so it was considered at
Alton—to sit at a table accommodating not only
a number of fellow students but a member of the
Faculty, one Mr. Peghorn, who instructed the
Junior and Senior classes in physics. However,
it must be said that Tommy allowed “Peg’s” presence
to “cramp his style” very little, while—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
this is a secret between us—Mr. Peghorn, who had
taught boys for so long that his enthusiasm was
fast wearing thin, seldom lifted his head from
above his plate save when Tommy was going well.
Then he occasionally darted a frowning glance
toward that youth that might have silenced another
but that left Tommy untroubled. Perhaps
Tommy somehow knew that under that frown, or
behind it, Mr. Peghorn was secretly sympathetic.
When one has listened to conventional and uninspired
table-talk for many years even a jarring
note is a relief.</p>

<p>“Trouble with you guys,” declared Tommy in
that aggravating, assured manner of his, “is that
you can’t see beyond the end of your noses. You
get sore because Coach doesn’t win a game that he
doesn’t care two cents about.”</p>

<p>“A game’s a game,” said the freckle-faced boy
across the table.</p>

<p>“And a slice of beef’s a slice of beef,” retorted
Tommy, “but I noticed you were mighty careful
not to pick out a little one just now!”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” said another fellow above the
chuckles rewarding Tommy’s sally, “it doesn’t
look very well, Tommy, to play two games, as
we’ve done, and not win either of them. I say it
wouldn’t have hurt Johnny to have kept his best
men in and put the game on ice. Then he could
have tried out his subs if there was time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“Put the game on ice!” exclaimed Tommy.
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comment?</i> Those dumb-bells couldn’t put anything
on ice, Harry. They’re so dead on their feet
you could put lilies in their hands without waking
’em! Why, the only chance Johnny had of winning
to-day was to put in his third-string players.
If he had played his second-string all through he
might have tied, but it would have taken the third-string
bunch to win!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t talk like a baked apple,” protested
some one farther along. “Do you mean to say that
Banning could have pushed across for that touchdown
if the regulars had been in the line-up? If
you do you’re cuckoo!”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tres bien, cher ivorie solide.</i> What happened
in the first half when those mighty heroes held
forth? They pushed Banning all over the field,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">non</i>? And scored at will, did they not? Listen,
you big boob; if the first-string guys had played
through the game the score would have been something
like twenty-five to a goose-egg. We wouldn’t
have had even those miserable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">deux</i> points!”</p>

<p>This heresy brought forth, a groan of derision.
“Tommy, you’re a nut!” proclaimed Harry.
“You just like to hear yourself talk. I suppose
Lovell is a better quarter-back than Ted Ball and
Tifton is a better guard than Jonas Lowe! You’re
all wet, son!”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Tommy judicially, “Jonah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Slow may still have a slight edge on Tif, but Tif’s
coming along pretty fast. As for Ted Ball, he’s
the best quarter we’ve had in three years, but
you’ve got to have more than a quarter-back to
make a football team. Even without Ball the
backfield that played in the last half was far better
than the first combination. Look at Savell!
There’s a clever lad for you. If he isn’t on the
‘big time’ before I’m much older I’ll eat my hat.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you’ve got one,” said Harry.
“Savell was all right, but Storer’s a heap better.
Say, if the second and third bunch are so much
better, why doesn’t Johnny scrap the first and
put them in?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if he did eventually,”
answered Tommy, helping himself to half of a
neighbor’s biscuit. “After to-day’s game he’s
probably thinking of it more than ever. Of course
he’s likely to keep three or four of the first-string
crowd. They aren’t all rotten. Ted Ball and Billy
Haines and Joe Tate and, of course, Captain
Jonas, would probably stick. Maybe another.”</p>

<p>“You’re a crazy coot, Tommy!”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mille remerciements.</i> I may be crazy, but I’m
not foolish. You fellows don’t know a thing about
football, and I do. That’s why you find my remarks
incomprehensible.”</p>

<p>“Where’d you get your football knowledge?”
jeered one of his audience. “Taking tickets?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s all right, you piece of cheese rind,” replied
Tommy sweetly. “Perhaps between the lot
of you you can tell me who the lad is that’ll be doing
most of the scoring for us by the end of the
season. Perhaps you can, and then <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">encore</i> perhaps
you can’t!”</p>

<p>“Nip Storer.”</p>

<p>“Jim Galvin.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t have to be on the first line-up just
now,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“He means Fitz Savell,” suggested one.</p>

<p>Tommy shook his head sadly. “I didn’t think
you could,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Well, who is he?” demanded Harry, with a
wink for the table at large. “Any one we’ve ever
heard of?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say whether you’ve heard of him,
Harry. His name’s Hollins.”</p>

<p>“Hollins! You mean Bert Hollins?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Absolument.</i>”</p>

<p>“Why, that fellow hasn’t—isn’t—”</p>

<p>“I never said he was,” answered Tommy, pushing
back his chair and rising superbly for one of
his build. “I said he was going to be. Now don’t
chew the rag about it, pie-face, for it’s something
you know nothing of. Just remember what I’ve
told you and wait for developments. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon soir,
vous pauvre noix!</i>”</p>

<p>If the result of the Banning game disappointed
the spectators it quite as certainly disgruntled
most of the players, the first-string fellows particularly.
“Why in heck,” was the oft repeated
query, “didn’t he keep us in and let us score on
those dubs? Why, we were just getting to know
them!” The explanation that Coach Cade had desired
to provide experience for the substitutes, at
the cost of an unimportant contest, was accepted
but failed to satisfy. To be beaten by Banning
High School was viewed rather like a slap in the
face!</p>

<p>None of the regulars was any sorer than Chick
Burton that evening, and on the way across the
campus after supper he did a good deal of grousing,
with Bert as a more or less sympathetic audience.
Bert appreciated Chick’s view-point, but
he considered that Mr. Cade had taken an allowable
risk, and he tried to point that out to his
companion. But Chick refused to see it.</p>

<p>“Johnny’s here to help us win games,” he asserted
stoutly, “and not to make us look like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
bunch of dubs. If he wants to give the subs experience
let him do it in practice. We’ll give ’em
enough experience! If we can’t, all he’s got to do
is run ’em up against the Second. It’s all right
to save your good men when there’s an important
game coming, but we play New Falmouth next
week and there’s six days between, and New Falmouth
isn’t anything to get worried about, anyway.
Why, any one of us regulars could have
played four periods to-day and never turned a
hair! I was just getting good when he yanked me
out. Hang it, after the way those beggars ran us
around in the first half, we all wanted a chance to
sock it to ’em. Lum Patten was as mad as a hyena
about it. I thought sure Johnny would hear him
kicking. Rather wish he had, too. Say, I’ll bet
the Flubdub will have something to say next
week!”</p>

<p>The Flubdub was the popular name for the
school weekly. Its official title was The Doubleay,
but no one called it that.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Bert, “you had more luck
than I had, Chick, even if you didn’t play the game
through. I just sat on the bench and watched you
fellows get trampled on.”</p>

<p>“Trampled on nothing!” said Chick indignantly.
“You didn’t see me get trampled on. Nor
the others, either. Suppose Banning did hold us
for two periods. We were due for a come-back in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the last half, and a hard one, too! Where do you
get that trampled-on stuff?”</p>

<p>“I take it back,” laughed Bert. “Just the same,
Chick, Banning out-played you, and you know it.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Johnny sends us in there with instructions
to buck their line and not do any kicking
unless forced to. You heard the dope he
handed us. Said Banning was fast and shifty and
our best bet was to hammer the guards and tackles.
Well, he didn’t know what he was talking about.
Those fellows had a corking good line from end to
end and slammed us back every time we tried to
smash it. That guy who played opposite to me was
a regular man-killer! And look at the pair of
guards she had! Looks to me like Johnny had it
in for us and wanted to see us knocked cold!
Maybe we were slow, like he told us afterwards,
but I’ll tell the world that it would have taken a
mighty good defense to stop that passing game
of theirs to-day. We didn’t know how to meet it,
and that’s the truth of it; and I say that wasn’t
our fault. Johnny should have prepared us for
that crazy sort of stuff before we went in. Banning
would heave the ball thirty or forty yards
and we’d play back to meet it, and then she’d toss
one over the middle and make it good for five or
six or maybe eight yards before our backs could
get in on it. Maybe we were slow, but we were
fast enough to rub those guys’ faces in the mud if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
we’d been allowed to stay in! That’s what gets
my goat, hang it all: putting in a bunch of measly
scrubs just when things got interesting and we
were all set to go!”</p>

<p>“Fitz Savell played a nice game,” observed Bert
rather wistfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, sure, but the rest of them just flubbed
around. Look at the chance they had to score
when they were down near the thirty that time!
And look at the play Bus Lovell called for! Say,
who was in charge after Jonas quit, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Bus, I think.”</p>

<p>Chick snorted. “I’ll bet he was. Any one else
would have made him change that play down there.
Just handed them the very thing they were looking
for! Played right into their hands! Why, a child
could have seen that they were all set for that forward-pass!”</p>

<p>“I fancy the trouble,” said Bert, “was that Bus
didn’t have much of a choice of plays.”</p>

<p>“What of it? He needn’t have thrown the ball
away. Savell had been gaining right along, making
his own holes, pretty near. Why didn’t Bus
shift his line over and use a double-pass that
would have given Fitz a chance to slip around
tackle on the short side? We only needed about
five yards. Anyway, suppose he didn’t have the
plays? Whose fault is that? Johnny ought to
have given us enough to lick those guys to a frazzle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Beaten by a high school team! Blamed
nonsense!”</p>

<p>Chick relapsed into injured silence and they
crossed West street, a block from the campus, and
turned to the right in the direction of Mooney’s.
Bert hadn’t much desire to spend the evening in a
billiard parlor, but Chick had pleaded hard and
he had yielded. “You don’t have to play,” asserted
Chick. “I just want you to come along and
see me trim that Devore guy. He’s got a licking
coming to him after what he did to me Wednesday!”</p>

<p>“I’m to be the cheering section, eh?” Bert had
asked. “Well, all right. But understand, Chick,
that this has got to be an early party. Ten o’clock
sees this little golden head on the pillow, and that
means quitting the festivities by nine-thirty.”</p>

<p>“Sure, that’s all right. I’ll win two straight
to-night. I’m in the mood to conquer, old scout!
They wouldn’t let me lick Banning and I’ve just
got to beat up some one!”</p>

<p>Mooney’s wasn’t the disreputable place that
Bert pleased to pretend. It was large, well-appointed
and clean. There were fourteen tables on
the long floor and when the two boys entered every
one was in use. Bert hoped for an instant that the
fact would turn his companion back toward the
door and spare him some two hours of unenthusiastic
watching in the smoke-filled hall. But Chick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
was undisturbed, and led the way along the aisle
to where, near the back of the room, two youths
were playing bottle pool. They were probably
about twenty-three or four years of age, one a
lanky fellow with long freckled face, the other a
smaller, neatly-built chap with a face that might
have been very good-looking if the features had
been less peaked. He had rather colorless, small
eyes, set too close together, and Bert took a mild
dislike to Mr. Devore long before he discovered,
as he did subsequently, that the gentleman’s first
name was Lester. The game ended abruptly and
Bert shook hands with the two. The freckle-faced
fellow, who was introduced as Joe Mills, proposed
a four-handed game, but neither Chick nor Devore
seconded the proposal, and Bert flatly declined.
Joe wandered off presently and Bert saw him no
more that evening.</p>

<p>Chick explained to Devore at some length what
he intended to do to that gentleman, and Devore
pretended much concern, turning, however, to wink
at Bert, who had established himself in one of the
chairs ranged along the wall. Chick had quite recovered
his spirits and was even in a rather expansive
mood. The game started and Bert made
himself as comfortable as he could and looked on.
Devore was a presentable chap, neatly dressed in
inexpensive clothes of the sort usually labeled
“Varsity” or “Campus” and which are universally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
taboo at colleges. He wore a ring on one
hand which might—or might not—have been a diamond,
smoked cigarettes incessantly and talked
cheerfully in a pleasant voice, using much slang,
and an occasional oath when luck went against him.
Luck didn’t do that very often, however, for Devore
was a good player, using his cue with unconscious
dexterity and seeming never in doubt as
to what to do. Evidently he was no stranger to
Mooney’s, for he exchanged salutations frequently.
If Chick had not been a good player, too, that first
game of fifty points wouldn’t have lasted long. As
it was, however, it stretched out interminably, or
so it seemed to Bert; although he did find interest
in the last few minutes, when Devore overcame
Chick’s lead of eight and ran out the game.</p>

<p>Chick took the defeat smilingly, but Bert could
see that he was piqued. “I’ll play you for double
this time, Les,” he announced. Devore appeared
to hesitate, but he finally nodded. “You’re on,
Buddie,” he agreed.</p>

<p>Chick won the second game rather handily. Apparently
his adversary was not as steady a performer
as Bert had believed him, for several times
he fell down on shots that were not particularly
difficult. His good humor, however, never deserted
him; wherein he differed from Chick. Chick could
be as gay as a lark while winning, but if Devore
got the lead his banter ceased and he looked on in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
frowning, anxious silence. A miscue or a stroke
of ill-luck invariably produced a word or gesture
of annoyance from Chick. At such times Devore
was loudly sympathetic.</p>

<p>At the end of the second game Chick was again
in high spirits. “Come on now for the rubber,”
he said. “What about it? Same stakes?”</p>

<p>“You must want to ruin me,” laughed Devore.
“I’m no Millionaire Kid. I have to work for my
coin. Still, I’d like to quit even, so I’ll go you,
Buddie.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t got time, Chick,” Bert protested.
“It’s four after nine now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll hurry it up this time,” Chick laughed.
“It won’t take me long to beat this easy-mark!”</p>

<p>“Remember what you agreed,” said Bert.
“Nine-thirty was the limit.”</p>

<p>“Make it twenty-five points,” Devore suggested.
“I’m agreeable. I want to hit the hay early myself
to-night.”</p>

<p>Chick consented, although not very cheerfully,
and the third game began. Devore won the break
and cleaned the table very neatly, winning grudging
admiration from Bert. Chick went well for
a while, only to miss an easy shot, and Devore
pocketed the remaining balls. After the next
break, Devore, with the game practically won,
scratched, and Chick ran seven before over-anxiety
caused his Waterloo. Bert had never seen Chick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
so concerned about the winning of a game of pool
as he was now, and he wondered. The miss had
put him in a black temper, and he sat slumped in
a chair while Devore expertly and almost apologetically
ran out, taking the winning ball on a
double bank.</p>

<p>“Tell you what I’ll do,” exclaimed Chick impetuously.
“I’ll play you just one more of twenty-five
for two dollars! Come on now if you’re a
sportsman! What do you say?”</p>

<p>Devore shook his head. “No, sir, I’m through,
Buddy. I know when I’m well off, see? I had
luck that time, but—”</p>

<p>“Afraid, eh?” asked Chick. “I’ll say you had
luck! Come on, don’t be a quitter!”</p>

<p>Devore smiled but shook his head again, returning
his cue to its locked box. “Honest, I’ve got
to beat it, Chick. So have you. I’ll play you again
Monday night. How’s that?”</p>

<p>“What time is it, anyway?” Chick looked at his
watch and shrugged disappointedly. “Oh, all
right. Monday night then. Better bring your
horse-shoe along again, old man, for I’m going to
show you some real pool! Let’s settle up.”</p>

<p>“Outside,” said Devore. “Mooney’s sort of
strict, and what he don’t know won’t hurt
him.”</p>

<p>Bert followed them down the hall, dodging the
butts of busy cues, through an atmosphere thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
with tobacco smoke. Chick stopped at a desk and
paid his score and then they were outside and
Bert drew a long breath of the cool air with vast
relief. Chick peeled a dollar from a small wad of
bills and Devore carelessly thrust it into a pocket.
“Well, good night, you guys,” he said. “See you
Monday night, Chick?”</p>

<p>“You bet you will, you lucky coot,” replied
Chick. “Good night!” Bert set a fast pace toward
school, for it was well after the half-hour,
and since the sidewalks were still crowded with
the usual Saturday night throng, progress was
slow and conversation difficult. It wasn’t until
they had reached the comparatively empty stretch
of State street that Chick voiced his disgust. “If
you hadn’t been so keen on getting back,” he declared,
“I’d have beaten that game. You don’t get
a chance when you’re playing only twenty-five
points and the other fellow has the first break.
I’d be three dollars to the good instead of a dollar
out; nearly two dollars out counting what I had
to pay at the desk!”</p>

<p>“Mean to say you were playing for two dollars
a game?” asked Bert incredulously.</p>

<p>“Sure; that is the last two games. We only had
a dollar on the first. We never played for more
than a dollar before, and I guess Les was sort of
scared. Gosh, that fellow had luck to-night, didn’t
he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“He seems to be a pretty clever lad at it,” said
Bert.</p>

<p>“Oh, he plays a good game, all right,” assented
Chick, “but he makes some pretty punk shots, too;
generally when he can’t afford it. In the pinches
he gets kind of nervous, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Do you usually beat him?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, anyway, I win oftener than he does.
He has his lucky nights, like to-night.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me, Chick, two dollars is a good deal
to play for, supposing you’ve got to bet at all.
What’s the idea? You and I always have plenty
of sport with nothing up except the price of the
game.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, a fellow plays better if he has a bet
up. He started it. Offered to bet me a quarter
one night and I took him up. Then I came back at
him with fifty cents and then, first thing I knew,
we were playing for a dollar. Well, if he can
stand it I can, I guess. Bet you he doesn’t make
more than twenty a week.”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d cut out the betting,” said Bert.
“You can have just as good fun, Chick. Besides,
if Faculty heard about it—”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, don’t be a Woeful Willy, Bert! How
the dickens would Faculty get hep? Besides,
there’s no school rule saying you mustn’t bet a
dollar on a game of pool, is there?”</p>

<p>“No, I never heard of one,” owned Bert, “but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Faculty has a way of making rules at short order.
Mind shaking a leg a bit? It’s twelve minutes to
ten. If I were you, Chick, I’d play less pool, anyway.
Two or three nights a week is sort of overdoing
it, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Why is it? Might as well be doing that as sitting
around in the room. There’s nothing wrong
with Mooney’s place, is there? You saw what it
was like to-night.”</p>

<p>“N-no, there’s nothing wrong with it, I guess;
except that a lot of betting goes on there and the
crowd isn’t exactly the sort a fellow would pick out
to spend an evening with.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, the crowd’s all right. Just because
they don’t happen to be our sort doesn’t mean anything,
Bert. Take Les Devore, now. Of course he
isn’t a college fellow, and all that sort of tosh, but
he’s a mighty decent guy, just the same. Works
hard for his living and gets his fun playing a little
pool.”</p>

<p>“What does he work at?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“Railroading. He’s something over at the
freight yard, I believe. Why?”</p>

<p>“I just wondered. His hands don’t look as if he
did an awful lot of work, Chick.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott, I didn’t say he handled freight!
He probably works in the office. Some sort of a
clerk, I dare say. I guess you don’t like him, from
the way you talk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know enough about him,” replied the
other evasively. “I’ll own up, though, old chap,
that I wasn’t strangely attracted to him this evening.”</p>

<p>“What was wrong with him?” demanded Chick
irritably.</p>

<p>“For one thing, he plays too good a game of
pool. I wouldn’t be surprised, Chick, if you found
out that playing pool is Devore’s real work.”</p>

<p>“Forget it! He doesn’t play as well as I do, and
you can’t say that I make a—a profession of it!”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t yet,” answered Bert as he followed
his companion up the steps of the dormitory, “but
I have a hunch that that bird is going to improve
fast!”</p>

<p>“Is, eh? Well, he isn’t going to improve any
faster than I do,” replied Chick, with a comfortable
laugh. “Come along Monday night and watch
me pick the pin feathers off him!”</p>

<p>“No, thanks, I’ve had all the smoke I can stand
for six months. Wonder why it’s against the law
to ventilate a billiard hall!”</p>

<p>“Gosh, you’re getting as pernickety as an old
maid!” jeered Chick. “Tobacco smoke’s good for
you, old scout. Keeps the moths out of your system,
and all that.”</p>

<p>“What do you think I am?” laughed Bert. “A
parlor rug?”</p>

<p>Bert beat the clock and was in bed when its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
hands pointed to ten. Chick undressed more leisurely,
reviewing his and his adversary’s performance,
and was still solicitously slicking down his
hair when the fateful hour was announced by the
booming of the church bell across the campus.</p>

<p>“Orders,” remarked Bert, good-naturedly
ironic, “don’t mean anything in your life, do they,
Charles?”</p>

<p>“Orders? Oh, that! Listen to me, son.
Johnny’s got to square himself for what he did
this afternoon before I put myself out obeying any
orders of his. Say, I hope to goodness the Flubdub
hauls him over the coals for losing that
game!”</p>

<p>“He should worry,” yawned Bert.</p>

</div>


<p>The Flubdub did about what Chick wanted it to
do. That is to say, it didn’t haul Coach Cade over
the coals, as Chick put it, but it certainly expressed
its disapproval in unmistakable terms in an editorial
article which ran all down the first column
and turned the next. It wasn’t rude, of course;
the Flubdub was never that; but it let the world
know that it was disappointed in the outcome of the
Banning game, that in its judgment a blunder had
been made and that Coach Cade had made it.
Then it intimated that possibly the coach had
acted under a misapprehension, and, in case he
had, it proceeded to set him right.</p>

<p>“While it is true,” remarked the paper, “that
the Kenly Hall game is the important event on the
schedule, and the one by which we measure the
Team’s success, yet there must be a limit to the
sacrifices we are willing to make to insure a triumph
over the ancient rival. We are not satisfied
to witness a series of early season defeats even
if assured that a final victory awaits us. Nor do
we consider that the loss of early season contests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
can have sufficient bearing on the ultimate success
of the Team to warrant them. We are better
pleased with a policy which accepts each succeeding
adversary as a worthy foe and not merely as a
stepping-stone to a distant goal. While the danger
of over-confidence is recognized, yet there is also
an equal peril in lack of confidence. A team which
is frequently beaten may easily develop an inferiority
complex. A firm belief in its ability to
conquer is a valuable asset for any team, and to
convince a team that it possesses that ability it
must be allowed to win an occasional game. Another
aspect also deserves consideration. A reputation
for success in athletics is a magnet which
draws many students to a school, and in this age
of publicity such a reputation must be earned, not
merely claimed. While we of Alton may be satisfied
to consider as successful a football team which
defeats Kenly Hall in November, irrespective of
how many games it has lost beforehand, others will
judge that team by its season’s record, and if that
record includes several defeats by minor adversaries
our satisfaction will not prevent those
others from considering our Football Team a failure.
And the Doubleay believes with them that
such a team is a failure, for there is no gainsaying
that the victor’s laurels must go to the team which
wins often and decisively, and not to the team
which merely conquers once. All of which is respectfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
submitted for the consideration of those
in authority.”</p>

<p>“That ought to hold Johnny awhile,” chuckled
Chick after a perusal of the editorial. “And
Homer’s dead right about it, too.”</p>

<p>“Homer Johnson?” asked Bert. “Think he
wrote it?”</p>

<p>“Of course he did. It sounds just like him.
Homer waves a wicked quill!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bert slowly, “I’m not so sure that
Johnny deserves that lecture. Being a football
coach can’t be exactly a bed of roses, Chick, and
it seems to me the least the School can do is refrain
from butting in and making his job harder than
it is. They say Johnny’s going to quit this fall,
anyway, and you know blame well he isn’t going
to pass up any chances to make his last season a
successful one. He will bring off a win over
Kenly if it’s humanly possible.”</p>

<p>“And that’s just the point,” replied Chick, slapping
the paper for emphasis. “He’s working for
a win over Kenly and letting us get licked all
along the line! That’s what Homer’s kicking
about; and what we’re all kicking about. A
Kenly victory is big stuff, and all that, and we sure
want it, but, hang it, Bert, we don’t want to be
licked by every two-bit school we take on. And
high schools, too!”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t speak so disrespectfully of high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
schools, Charles. There are plenty of them that
could lick us to a standstill. Besides, you exaggerate.
Only one high school has beaten us so
far.”</p>

<p>“Well, Southport isn’t much better,” grunted
Chick. “And we play New Falmouth High day
after to-morrow, and there’s no knowing what
Johnny Cade has doped up for us!”</p>

<p>“I guess we won’t have much trouble with her.”</p>

<p>“We won’t if we’re allowed to trim her,” said
Chick. “But if Johnny tries another of his funny
tricks, like starting with the subs, there’s no telling.
The first year I was here New Falmouth came
mighty near beating us. I forget the score, but I
think it was 7 to 6. We kicked a goal after touchdown
and she didn’t.”</p>

<p>“I wish Johnny would let me in Saturday,”
sighed Bert.</p>

<p>“Maybe he will. I wouldn’t be surprised if he
left the first-string at home and just took the subs
along!”</p>

<p>“You seem to have it in for Johnny rather hard,
Chick.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, he made me mad last week. Yanked
me out just when I was learning how to handle that
big Banning tackle. Johnny is all right when he
doesn’t get foolish. As for his quitting this fall,
I don’t believe there’s anything in that, Bert.
Why would he? He gets a mighty good salary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
here and I don’t believe any other school is after
him.”</p>

<p>“As I understand it,” responded Bert, “he’s
going to give up coaching. He has a law practice
somewhere, I think, and he wants to get busy with
it. I suppose football coaching doesn’t lead to
anything. How much salary does he draw,
Chick?”</p>

<p>“Five, or so I’ve heard. I guess no one knows
but he and the Faculty.”</p>

<p>“Five thousand! Great Peter! Why, that’s
real money!”</p>

<p>“I’ll say so; for only three months in the year!
Still, I guess it keeps a fellow from doing much of
anything else. Take a law business. What good’s
a lawyer if he isn’t around when you want him,
eh? Of course, if a coach gets big money, like some
of them, they don’t have to worry about any other
business, I suppose. Some of the college coaches
draw down ten thousand.”</p>

<p>“Gosh!” breathed Bert. “Guess I’ll be a football
coach when I get through eddicatin’ myself.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to learn to play first,” chuckled
the other.</p>

<p>“I suppose so, but I don’t see how I’m to do
that if Johnny doesn’t use me once in a while. I’m
not so certain that I wouldn’t rather be on the
Scrub, Chick. You do get to play there, even if
it’s only against you dubs!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll get your chance all right,” Chick answered.
“Next year will be your big year, old
scout. Just hold your horses and do the best you
know how. You oughtn’t to kick, anyhow, Bert.
You’ve made the Team and won your letter already,
and that’s more than some fellows do before
their senior year.”</p>

<p>“I know, but what’s it get me? I’ll trade that
old letter any time for a half-hour in a real game!
I’m getting sort of tired of adorning that unsympathetic
bench and only getting into a scrimmage
when every one else has been used up.”</p>

<p>“‘He also serves,’ quoted Chick, ‘who only—’”</p>

<p>“Serve be blowed,” interrupted Bert shortly.
“I want to play football! Sitting and waiting isn’t
so good. I’d like a little fun and a little glory,
Chick.”</p>

<p>“You’d have had it if I’d been elected,” said
Chick.</p>

<p>“Whether I deserved it or not, eh?” laughed the
other.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” answered Chick, with dignity.
“I’d have looked after you. Where’s my
French Comp?”</p>

<p>“You’ve got your elbow on it, unless my eyes
deceive me. Speaking of that obnoxious language,
Chick, have you heard the new one Tommy Parish
got off the other day?”</p>

<p>“What’s that little fat shrimp kicking about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
now?” asked Chick, opening his book under the
light.</p>

<p>“Oh, this was just some of his French that he’s
always springing. He was over at practice; Monday,
I guess; and when Pete Ness made that nice
run Tommy gets up and yells ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Garcon, allez vous
en!</i>’”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Allez vous</i>— What did he mean?”</p>

<p>“Well,” laughed Bert, “‘Attaboy’ was the way
he translated it!”</p>

<p>“He’s a blamed fool,” growled Chick. “They
ought to keep him away from practice. He’s always
making a nuisance of himself with his smart-aleck
stuff. Next time he razzes me I’ll climb
into the stand and cuff his ears!”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s harmless,” said Bert. “Trying sometimes,
I’ll admit, but a distinct addition to the joy
of nations. Shut up and let me work out this
plaguy problem.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>“Wish you had this French to do,” moaned the
other.</p>

<p>Presumably Mr. Cade saw that editorial in the
school paper, but if he did he didn’t allow it to
affect his policy in the least. On Saturday he began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
sprinkling his first and second substitutes
through the team soon after the third period
started. The score was then 14 to 10 in Alton’s
favor, New Falmouth having proved rather better
than expected. To be sure, the latter’s first score
came as the result of a fumble by Ness, but the
youth who had recovered the ball on the home
team’s forty-three yards deserved his touchdown,
for he skillfully eluded three of the enemy and
fairly snatched himself from the grasp of Hop
Meecham, who had made a gallant chase and who
tackled just short of the five-yard line. New Falmouth
added a point to that touchdown and subsequently
dropped a goal from Alton’s twenty-eight
yards.</p>

<p>Alton’s own scores came as the result of a considerably
better offense than she had shown heretofore.
The backs worked well together and the
line was charged hard and fast. Galvin shot
through for Alton’s first score some six minutes
after the kick-off and Nip Storer ran the visitor’s
left wing for the second just before the half ended.
Nip also kicked both goals. A third score almost
resulted when, in the second quarter, the New
Falmouth quarter fumbled a punt and Chick fell
on it near the fifteen-yard line. Two attacks at the
line, however, gained but four yards and Ted
Ball’s heave to Chick grounded. On a kick formation
Nip Storer threw straight across center, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Joe Tate was not in position and the ball went to
the enemy. Alton impressed the spectators as at
least thirty per cent better than New Falmouth,
even if results didn’t prove it. There was still
something lacking in Alton’s attack; perhaps several
things; but the power appeared to be there.
The left of the line was weak and New Falmouth
romped through Meecham and Dozier several
times. The latter, at tackle, was a comparatively
easy problem for the opposing backs. The balance
of the line showed well on defense, Lum Patten,
at center, being an especially bright spot. Joe
Tate and Chick Burton were both fast under punts
and were generally on hand when the ball was
caught. Chick, however, still showed uncertainty
in the matter of tackling, and more than once an
enemy wriggled away and made yardage after
Chick reached him.</p>

<p>Mr. Cade started his substitutes in almost with
the kick-off of the second half, and before the third
period was well along only four regulars remained
in the line-up. There was, of course, a murmur of
disapproval from the stand, but the game was so
evidently Alton’s for the taking that censure was
light. For a period of perhaps five minutes New
Falmouth caused uneasiness in the home camp, for
she took the ball on steady rushing from her own
forty-yard line to Alton’s thirty-two before she
was halted. There Gus Thomas, playing left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
tackle, nailed a New Falmouth back behind his
line for a six-yard loss, and the misfortune broke
the enemy’s stride. An attempt at a forward
heave went bad, a wide run was smeared for no
gain and when, on fourth down, a courageous
youth tried to lift the ball over the bar by the
place-kick route from the forty-six yards the attempt
was foredoomed. The pigskin fell many
yards short and into Fitz Savell’s eager arms,
and Fitz dodged and wormed his way to his own
twenty-two before he was downed. That advance
was New Falmouth’s final bolt, and never again
did she make a first down.</p>

<p>Alton scored a third touchdown after some
twelve minutes of play, Couch going through the
enemy’s center from her six yards. Bus Lovell
missed the try-for-point. Again, in the last quarter,
Fitz Savell brought the crowd to its feet with
a long run from mid-field that put the pigskin
on New Falmouth’s seven yards. Bert was in
then, having just taken Keys’ place at right half,
and it was to Bert that Bus Lovell shot the ball
on the first down. The play was from balanced
line and Bert carried between the enemy right
tackle and right end. As those men were double
teamed, and as Fitz went ahead as interference,
Bert shot through cleanly and kept his feet to the
one yard. There he was simultaneously tackled by
the opposing full-back and quarter, but he managed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to get the ball over the line before he was
borne back. Again Bus failed to kick the goal.</p>

<p>The game ended some two minutes later, the
score 26 to 10, and Bert went off the field with the
rest of the squad, after a somewhat breathless
cheer for the adversary, striving hard not to show
the elation he felt. Since that was the first touchdown
he had ever scored against an outside team,
disguising his pleasure wasn’t easy. He found
himself grinning several times on the way to the
gymnasium and straightened his mouth hastily,
hoping none of the others had seen. Chick, again
rather disgruntled because he hadn’t been allowed
to play more than slightly over two periods, smote
Bert on the back as they entered the building.</p>

<p>“Good stuff, old scout!” he declared. “That
was a nice little scamper of yours. You’re a credit
to my training.”</p>

<p>Bert smiled in as off-handed a manner as he
could manage. “No one could have failed on that
play,” he answered. “That hole was as wide as
a barn door, Chick. Gus Thomas and Bus put out
the tackle, and Couch—”</p>

<p>“Save your breath. I saw the play. I didn’t
say you worked a miracle, did I? Just the same,
you delivered the goods. And you got off so fast
you blame near overran your interference, too!
If that tackle hadn’t been playing too far in he
could have smeared it easy. You want to watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
out for that, Bert. Keep behind your interference,
even if it slows you up. If you don’t you’ll mess
the play.”</p>

<p>Later there was another word of commendation,
this time from Mr. Cade. And, as before, it contained
a warning. “You got through very prettily,
Hollins, on that off-tackle play,” he said, “but
you must be careful another time to let your interference
reach the line well ahead of you. You
were much too close on Savell. A good deal depends
on timing yourself right, Hollins.” Mr.
Cade smiled and turned away and Bert went on
to the showers, not quite so pleased with himself.</p>

<p>“Some one,” he reflected as he squirmed under
the spray, “is always taking the joy out of life!
Still, I guess he’s right. I did hustle Savell a bit.
Pshaw, there’s nothing to get high-hat about. It
just happened to be the right sort of a play for me.
I’m too light to do anything unless I have three or
four other fellows helping me! I wish I weighed
thirty pounds more, gosh ding it! Besides, what
made that play easy was that New Falmouth expected
Fitz would get the ball and were watching
him to hit the other side. Trouble with me is I
have to have a skirmish party go ahead of me and
clean out the woods before I can get through!”</p>

<p>As a result of these and similar cogitations he went
to supper in a chastened frame of mind and refused
to accept any of the clapping that greeted
his appearance in dining hall as a personal tribute.
Then, afterwards, emerging alone, he ran into
Tommy Parish in the corridor and Tommy nailed
him. Tommy, although he had recently finished a
hearty supper, was munching salted peanuts without
evident effort. He held out the small packet to
Bert, but the latter shook his head.</p>

<p>“Won’t let you?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“I guess so, but I’m full up.”</p>

<p>Tommy observed him with patent incredulity.
“After that chow?” he asked jeeringly. “Yes,
you are! Better have some. They’re fresh.”
Then, as Bert again declined: “Say, you got your
oar in at last, didn’t you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Got my oar in? What are you talking about,
Tommy?”</p>

<p>“Why, this afternoon. Pshaw, I knew you’d
show them how it’s done if they’d let you. And
you did, too, Bertie. Yeah, you pulled off something
rather neat. I’ve been watching you right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
along; ever since last fall. Been expecting you’d
bust in before this, but I guess you’ve got some
pretty fair guys to run against. Savell, for instance.
He’s good. I said he was first time I saw
him play. Just like with you, Bert. I generally
manage to pick the winners!”</p>

<p>“Are you trying to tell me that I’m a winner?”
laughed Bert. Tommy emptied the remaining
peanuts from the sack to his mouth and contented
himself with a nod. “You’re a humorist, Tommy.
Going my way?”</p>

<p>Tommy nodded again and fell into step.
“You’re right about Fitz Savell, though,” said
Bert warmly. “Fitz is a winner and no mistake.
Wasn’t that a corking run of his to-day? Gee,
but that fellow can twist!”</p>

<p>“Sokayou,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Come again?”</p>

<p>Tommy swallowed convulsively and obliged.
“So can you, I said. Listen. Savell’s mighty
good, Bert, but he isn’t a bit better than you are.
Only thing is, he’s getting a chance to show and
you aren’t. Say, know what I told the fellows at
our table the other night? Well, I told them that
by the end of the season you’d be the guy who’d be
doing most of our scoring.”</p>

<p>“Me!” Bert looked searchingly at his companion’s
countenance, but he failed to detect sarcasm
therein. Instead, Tommy appeared to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
quite serious, even earnest. “What did the other
fellows do?” inquired Bert. “Hoot?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they didn’t believe it,” replied Tommy
easily. “But we should worry, eh?”</p>

<p>Bert laughed, not amusedly but with slight irritation.
“You may mean well, Tommy,” he said,
“but I rather wish you wouldn’t make crazy remarks
like that, if you don’t mind. It makes me
look rather an ass, you know.”</p>

<p>Tommy’s slightly protuberant eyes expressed
perplexity. “How do you mean, ass?” he inquired.
“How do you mean, crazy remarks?
How do you mean—”</p>

<p>“I mean that fellows might think that I agreed
with you, of course,” answered Bert, grinning in
spite of himself. “I don’t want to look like a conceited
fool, Tommy.”</p>

<p>“Mean you don’t agree with me? Mean you
don’t know you’re a cracking good player? Pouf,
you’re stringing me! Why, I sized you up a long
time ago, Bert. ‘There,’ I said to myself, ‘is a lad
that’s going to show ’em some football before very
long!’ Yes, sir, I generally manage to pick the
winners. I don’t play the game myself; I tried it
once but I wasn’t built just according to specifications;
but that doesn’t keep me from seeing what’s
going on and what’s coming off. I sized you up
for a clever running back the first time I saw you
in action. That was last fall when you were on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the Scrub Team, Bert. Why, I haven’t missed a
practice session since I came here, hardly! Fellows
say I’m fresh and shoot off my mouth.”
Tommy shrugged, looked regretfully at the rumpled
sack he still held and tossed it in the general
direction of the rubbish barrel at the corner of
Upton. “Maybe I do, but some one’s got to tell
the truth! Take Johnny Cade now. He’s too easy.
Say, know something? Well, if I was coach of
this team, or any other team, for that matter, I’d
see that fellows jumped when I spoke to ’em. Yes,
sir, when I said ‘Hep!’ they’d hep! Johnny’s too—too
soft. Oh, I know he can be rough if he wants
to, but that isn’t the trick. Fellows are naturally
lazy, Bert. You’ve got to prod ’em all the time if
you’re going to get ’em to pull. Johnny doesn’t
prod. He just says ‘Gee’ or ‘Haw’ and the whole
crowd move about as fast as a yoke of oxes—oxen,
I mean. That’s where I come in and do my little
stunt, see? When I catch a fellow soldiering I
get after him, you bet. They don’t like it, of
course. Let ’em not!” Tommy smiled comfortably.
“It’s for their own good. They offer to
punch my nose and knock my block off and all that,
but I notice they don’t do it. They know mighty
well that when I say they’re rotten they are
rotten!”</p>

<p>Bert paused on the steps of Upton and stared at
Tommy with a new interest. Tommy, feeling unsuccessfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
about his pockets for further provender,
gazed complacently across the twilit campus.
Yielding to an impulse, Bert asked: “Doing anything,
Tommy?”</p>

<p>“No, I guess not. I did think of going to the
movie, but it’s one of those vamp pictures, and
they make me sick.”</p>

<p>“Come on up to the room then and tell me more
about it,” invited the other.</p>

<p>“About what? Got anything good up there?”</p>

<p>“Great Scott, you’re not still hungry!”</p>

<p>Tommy grinned. “Pouf, I’m never really
hungry, I guess, but I can generally eat.”</p>

<p>“You mean you do generally eat,” laughed
Bert. “Maybe I can dig up something to keep life
in your poor thin body. Come on.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t been in here for a long time,” said
Tommy as he selected the easiest chair and relaxed
with a sigh. “You and Chick still hit it off? He’d
get on my nerves mighty quick, I guess. He’s
what I call a hard frost.”</p>

<p>“Chick’s a fine chap when you know him,” said
Bert. “He and I have been friends a long time.”</p>

<p>“Meaning I’m to quit throwing off on him, eh?
Oh, all right. He’s not bad, even if he is trying to
see how rotten he can play.”</p>

<p>“Rot,” replied Bert warmly. “Chick’s doing
as well as any fellow on the team, Tommy, and you
know it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re a liar,” responded Tommy sweetly,
“and <em>you</em> know it! Ever since he got thrown
down at the election last winter he’s been as sore
as a boil, and ever since he started to play football
last month he’s been just passing the time.
I’m not the only one who knows it, either, if you
don’t—or pretend you don’t. Johnny’s got his
number, believe me! Some fine day Chick’s going
to wake up and find himself on the outside looking
in!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” muttered Bert. But he was uneasily
conscious that there might be some truth
in Tommy’s prediction. Chick had been rather
poor this fall, and it was scarcely possible that
Coach Cade hadn’t noted the fact. Bert tossed
a half-emptied box of drug-store candy into
Tommy’s lap and, because the other had jarred
him, said irritably: “Go ahead and kill yourself,
you silly pig!”</p>

<p>Tommy removed the lid and peered dubiously
into the box. “Not much chance of killing myself
with what’s here,” he stated derisively. “Have
some?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks.” Bert sat down at the study table
and thoughtfully rolled a pencil between his palms.
“Rather a thankless job, yours, Tommy. I mean
fellows don’t take kindly to your criticism, eh?”</p>

<p>Tommy shrugged, crossed his knees and regarded
a chocolate disapprovingly. Beyond a
doubt it had been confined too long in that box!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
“If you mean I’m not popular, you’re right. But
popularity never got any one anything much.
Look at History. Men who really did things, men
who won success, were unpopular. Look at—at
Cæsar, and Napoleon and Lincoln and—”</p>

<p>“Your examples are not so good, Tommy,” Bert
laughed. “The gentlemen you refer to were rather
unfortunate in the end, weren’t they?”</p>

<p>“What of it? They did big things while they
were alive. If you’re one of these popular, well-liked
guys about all you get is a slap on the back.
When there’s a real plum to be handed out the
popular guy takes tickets at the door. Every one
likes him fine, but when there’s a big job to be done
no one even sees him. The job goes to some rough-neck
who has so many enemies he has to carry a
gun! No, sir, being liked is a handicap, Bert. If
you want to be something and get somewhere talk
rude, step on folks’ toes and get yourself hated.
It’s the surest way.”</p>

<p>“Tommy, you certainly get hold of some funny
notions,” said Bert, half admiringly. “It must
take a lot of your time to think them up.”</p>

<p>Tommy waved a hand carelessly. “I like to
think,” he said. “Most fellows don’t. When you
call my ideas funny, though, you just mean that
they don’t happen to be yours. That’s typical of
your class, Bert. Anything strange—I mean unfamiliar—you
call funny.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“My class? Meaning the Junior?”</p>

<p>“No, class in society.” Tommy rejected an unpromising
piece of candy and searched farther.
“Wealthy and conservative, you know. Hide-bound
New England. All that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“I’m New England, if you like,” agreed Bert,
amused, “but I’m not exactly wealthy, and I do
hope I’m not hide-bound. That doesn’t sound
comfortable. Aren’t you New England yourself,
you crazy coot?”</p>

<p>“No. I live there, but that’s all. We’re from
Western New York originally. My father’s folks
were Welsh and my mother’s Irish.”</p>

<p>“I might have known there was Irish in you,”
said Bert. “That’s how you come to like a scrap
so well, Tommy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like scraps. You never saw me pick a
quarrel yet. No one ever did. Sometimes fellows
resent what I say to ’em, but that’s their fault.”</p>

<p>“You came pretty close to having a scrap on
your hands the other night over in Coles Wistar’s
room,” Bert reminded him dryly.</p>

<p>“What of it? I didn’t start it. Chick called
me a fat loafer, didn’t he? Then I said he was
playing a rotten game of football, which was the
gospel truth, and he got on his ear! He’s short-tempered,
that guy.”</p>

<p>On the heels of that assertion Chick hurried
into the room, looked surprised to see who the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
visitor was and said, “Hello, Tommy,” not very
enthusiastically before turning to Bert. “Coming
along?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Mooney’s? I think not, Chick.”</p>

<p>“Thought you said you would. You can change
your mind quicker than any fellow I ever saw!
Where’d you get to after supper? I wanted you
to go over to Jim Galvin’s. Well, if you won’t
come, all right. I’ve got to hurry.”</p>

<p>“Hope you have luck,” said Bert as Chick found
a cap and stuck it on the back of his head.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s about time I did,” rejoined Chick
as he opened the door. “See you later, old scout.”</p>

<p>“Mooney?” asked Tommy, when Chick had departed.
“Who’s he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just a fellow who lives in town. Chick goes
to see him now and then.”</p>

<p>Tommy accepted the explanation, but a close
observer would have suspected that it didn’t altogether
satisfy him. He laid the now empty box
on the window-seat with a sigh of mingled regret
and repletion, stretched his rather pudgy legs out
and then startledly clapped a hand to the back of
his neck. He wiggled his head sidewise several
times, and then up and down, while Bert gazed at
him in puzzlement. Finally he sighed again, this
time with pure concern, and murmured: “Darn
the luck! Another Job!”</p>

<p>“Another what?” asked Bert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Job. That’s what I call them,” explained
Tommy, evidently very low in his mind. “Job
had ’em, you know.”</p>

<p>“Had what?” Bert was still in the dark.</p>

<p>“Gee, don’t you read your Bible?” asked
Tommy irritably. “Boils, of course! I’m always
having ’em. Makes me sick. I’ll bet it’s the water
here.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose eating so much has anything
to do with it?” Bert inquired innocently.
“Candy and peanuts and that sort of stuff?”</p>

<p>Tommy shook his head cautiously, once more extending
an exploring hand to the back of his neck.
“I don’t believe so,” he replied soberly. “I tried
dieting once. Didn’t eat any candy for a whole
month. But it didn’t make any difference. I had
Jobs just the same. I guess it’s the water, maybe,
or something. Guess I’d better go up and put
stuff on it.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” said Bert as sympathetically as he
could manage. “I hope you won’t get it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll get it,” answered the other resignedly.
“I always do.” Then, more cheerfully, he
added: “Anyway, I won’t have Gym class for a
while!”</p>

<p>At the door Bert stopped him. “By the way,
Tommy, I wish you’d tell me something.” Tommy
paused, turned and, holding a hand to the incipient
boil, looked inquiring. “What you said about my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
playing,” went on Bert with some embarrassment.
“You didn’t really mean it, eh?”</p>

<p>“What do you care if I did or didn’t?” asked
Tommy, suddenly a pessimist. “You’re like all
the others. Think I don’t know anything about
football just because I don’t play it.”</p>

<p>“No, honestly, Tommy, I don’t think that. Fact
is, I believe you know a lot about it. That’s why
I’d like to know whether you really think I’ll
make a player. You see, I’ve tried pretty hard,
but I don’t seem to do as well as most of the
others.”</p>

<p>“Huh,” said Tommy, evidently mollified,
“you’re a player right now. Say, want to know
how to break into fast company right away? All
right, I’ll tell you.” Tommy lowered his voice,
glancing left and right along an empty corridor,
and became gravely confidential. “Don’t put your
head down, Bert. Keep it up and use your eyes.
Look for the opening. Sometimes it isn’t where it
ought to be, you know. All right. If you look
sharp you can find it. If you put your head down
and just follow the interference blind you run into
a snag half the time. Get the idea? Look where
you’re going! <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Employer la oeil, mon ami! Aussi,
chercher la trou!</i> Thanks for the feed. Night!”</p>

<p>When Tommy had gone toward the stairs with
a rather dejected amble, Bert closed the door, sat
down and considered the advice. Of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Tommy was a good deal of a nut, but he evidently
did use his bean, Bert reflected, and he did seem
to know something about the art of football playing.
Bert tried to remember whether he did or
didn’t put his head down when he took the ball.
He couldn’t decide until he got to his feet, stooped,
with the knuckles of one hand on the carpet, listened
to an imaginary signal and jumped forward,
his hands wide for a mythical ball. When his
hands were clasped against his stomach he stopped
abruptly in his journey of the room, for he had
discovered what he sought. The instant he had
clasped the imagined ball to him he had dropped
his head!</p>

<p>He went back to his chair and considered again.
What he had just done he doubtless always did.
In which case Tommy’s advice deserved respect.
Hitting the line with the head down might be an
excellent plan under some conditions, and Bert
recalled that he had seen it done time and again,
but when you were crossing over or running wide
it plainly wasn’t the wise proceeding. He guessed
that “Head up!” was right. To-day, for instance,
he had gone through without difficulty because the
hole was awaiting him, a fine wide opening made
by four of his team-mates and neatly cleaned out
by Fitz Savell, but suppose the hole hadn’t been
so wide, or hadn’t been there at all. In that case
he would have smashed up against Fitz or an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
enemy forward and there’d have been no gain,
because there wasn’t any doubt in his mind that
he had run blindly, his head lowered and his eyes
on the ground. Well, that wouldn’t do. He would
practice keeping the old bean up and look where
he was going. Of course, once free of the line he
had probably been in the habit of raising his head
and using his eyes, but going through it he had
fallen into the way of the plunging backs who,
with ball hugged to stomach and body bent sharply
over it, shot themselves forward like human battering-rams.
Funny, he thought, that no one had
noted that and corrected him before. Funny that
it should have been first pointed out to him by a
chap who didn’t play and was popularly considered
a joke!</p>

<p>A few minutes later Bert took himself off to a
room down the corridor and played two games of
chess at which he was badly beaten because he kept
thinking about football and Tommy Parish’s prediction
most of the time. At ten o’clock he was
in bed, if not asleep. Even if you couldn’t slumber
you could obey the rules. Chick was still out
when the hour struck. In fact, it was nearly a
quarter past when he stole in. Bert gave him a
drowsy greeting and got a grunt in reply. Plainly
the luck had not gone Chick’s way to-night and he
was rather out of temper. He made a good deal
of unnecessary noise during the process of preparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
for bed, with the result that eventually
Bert became fully awake.</p>

<p>“You’re a noisy brute, Chick,” he yawned.</p>

<p>For reply Chick slammed a drawer emphatically.
But presently, having put out the light and found
his bed, speech came to him. “Well, why don’t
you ask me if I won?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I will. Did you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure! One game out of three! Talk about
luck! Say, that fellow couldn’t miss to-night if
he tried!”</p>

<p>“Sometimes, I think, he does try,” murmured
Bert.</p>

<p>“What?” Then, as Bert didn’t repeat the observation,
he continued disgustedly: “I had him
thirty-one to six on the last game and he went out
without a break! The balls just rolled everywhere
he wanted them to, the lucky stiff! Gee, it would
make you sick!”</p>

<p>“Did you bet with him?”</p>

<p>“Naturally. And lost, too.”</p>

<p>“How much?”</p>

<p>“Plenty,” answered Chick briefly. “But I’ll
get it back, don’t you worry. He’s had luck for a
week now, but it can’t keep up all the time, and I’ll
sure make a killing soon. He certainly got my goat
to-night, though!”</p>

<p>“Tough luck,” murmured Bert. “Well, good
night.”</p>

<p>“Not so blamed good,” Chick growled.</p>

<small>SUBS VS. SCRUB</small></h2>
</div>


<p>With the beginning of the fourth week of the
season, the football situation at Alton Academy
had become fairly well straightened out. The
squad was down to thirty-four, about as low as it
was likely to go, the Second Team had hit its stride
and was providing tough opposition four or five
times a week, and, with the approach of the first
important contest, that with Lorimer Academy
next Saturday, the preliminary season was coming
to an end in a fairly normal manner. The victory
over New Falmouth, while of no great consequence,
had shown coach and players and School that the
Team possessed latent possibilities, something
which the School, at least had begun to doubt.
One win out of three starts was a record that was
scarcely impressive. However, if Alton was having
her difficulties, so, too, was her rival, Kenly
Hall. Kenly had won her first game handsomely
enough, had lost her second without apparent
rime or reason and had been able to do no better
on Saturday last than play Oak Grove to a
scoreless tie. Since Oak Grove was normally a
small-caliber team, Kenly’s last performance had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
brought encouragement to Alton. Kenly almost
always turned out a scoring eleven, and her inability
to put anything over on Oak Grove suggested
that this fall, for once, she was minus heavy
artillery.</p>

<p>On Monday the substitutes held the center of the
stage at Alton, since those who had played for any
length of time on Saturday were excused after
signal work. The Second came across, rearing to
go, and engaged an adversary largely composed
of second-choice substitutes. Bert, somewhat to
his surprise, was allowed to start at right half.
Lovell was at quarter for a while, and Tyron and
Couch completed the backfield. The scrimmage
went slowly, for Mr. Cade was trying out two new
plays—new, at least, to the team—and the play
was frequently stopped for criticism or instruction.
Mr. McFadden’s charges were an eager,
hard-fighting lot, and in the first ten minutes
neither side scored. Field-goals were barred to-day,
except for which both First and Scrub might
have had three points. Bert tried his best to act
on Tommy Parish’s suggestion and keep his head
up when he went at the line. Sometimes he did it,
but habit was strong and more times he failed.
Still, he comported himself fairly well, and when
he was relegated to the bench at the end of the first
half was able to assure himself that he had done
as well as Tyron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>In the second half of the scrimmage Parkhurst
started in Bert’s position, but he was so weak on
defense that he lasted but a few minutes and gave
way to Keys. The Second got under way when the
ball was fumbled by Riding, who had succeeded
Lovell toward the end of the first session, and
picked up by a Scrub end. From their own forty-two
yards Mr. McFadden’s pets smashed along to
the First’s thirty-one, using a wide sweep that
worked with all the efficiency of a steam-roller.
Shelfer, playing right end, was of so little use
when the play came on his side that Mr. Cade sent
him off and looked about for a substitute. Ends,
however, were scarce this afternoon, and finally
Fitz Savell was tried. Fitz might have claimed
immunity, since he had worked rather hard Saturday,
but that was far from his thoughts. At end,
a position he had played awhile a year back, Fitz
fitted excellently, so well that runs around the
First Team’s right ceased after the next attempt.
Too close to the side-line to try a play around
the other end, Scrub piled into right guard for no
gain and then shot off a neat forward-pass to the
left that was caught close to the boundary and
advanced for a total gain of seventeen yards.
From the First’s twelve yards the Second went
over for a touchdown in three plays, the final one
being an unexpected plunge through a loose center
by quarter after a seeming attack on tackle had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
fooled the defenders. Couch was slightly hurt in
that play and Franklin took his place at full-back.
No goal was tried and the First kicked off again
and the Scrub left half was downed without a gain
by Fitz Savell. One plunge netted two yards and
Scrub punted. Keys caught on his forty-three and
the First started to hammer the right of the adversary’s
line and made good going to the opposite
forty. There, two smashes were stopped and
Keys made an ineffectual attempt to take a long
heave from Franklin. Time was taken out for the
Scrubs and Coach Cade seized the opportunity
to make several changes. Two new linemen were
brought in and Keys was sent off to the showers.
Coach Cade’s demand for another half-back
brought Jake, the trainer, to his feet.</p>

<p>“Half-back! Come on, one o’ you! All right,
What’s-your-name!”</p>

<p>But “What’s-your-name” didn’t get well onto
the field before he was turned back. “This man
doesn’t know these plays, Jake,” called the coach.
“Who else is there?”</p>

<p>“Not a one, Coach. They’ve all been worked.”</p>

<p>“Well, send some one. Hollins, you come.”</p>

<p>So Bert went back, even more surprised than
before, and Mr. Cade said: “Take it here, Hollins.
Let’s see what you can do. We ought to get a score
this time.”</p>

<p>It was fourth down and Don Riding called for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
kick formation with Franklin back. Bert took his
place behind right tackle, the signals started and
the ball shot back. Franklin, however, had had
woefully little practice at taking the pass from
center and he made a poor job of it. The cry of
“<em>Ball! Ball!</em>” arose piercingly as the lines
swayed. Bert jumped to the right to head off an
opponent who was leaking through, and just at
that moment something bounded against his leg.
He threw himself outside and let the adversary
stumble past him. Then he was running toward
the trickling ball, one of several in pursuit. A
lucky, half-hearted leap on the part of the pigskin
coincided with Bert’s swoop, and he straightened
up, tucking the ball tightly to him, and started
ahead. A falling player sent him staggering to
the right, but he recovered and headed in. It
looked like a forlorn hope, for the enemy seemed
closing in on him. Then, however, Tolman shot
past him and went crashing into the nearest of
the foe and Bert sped around the falling forms
and found his pace.</p>

<p>It wasn’t difficult after that. Only one tackler
threatened and a straight-arm sent him spinning
aside. Bert had picked up the ball near the
Scrub’s forty-yard line and by the time he was
racing over the twenty he was a good two yards in
advance of the nearest foe. The Scrub safety man
had run in at the warning of the fumble and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
was a poor third when the goal-line was reached.
Bert crossed it winded but serene and yielded
gracefully to the vindictive tackle of the first
pursuer. Mr. Cade, trotting slowly up, said:
“Good work, Hollins! Nice dodging. Never
mind the try-for-point, fellows! First kicks off!”</p>

<p>Returning somewhat breathlessly up the field,
Bert puzzled over the coach’s reference to dodging.
Bert couldn’t remember having dodged once!
However, he had won praise from Mr. Cade, and
that was certainly good luck! For that matter, the
whole proceeding, he reflected, had been a matter
of luck! He guessed the touchdown wouldn’t
raise his stock much.</p>

<p>Yet, on Tuesday, the indications were that it
had, and that he had slipped overnight a little farther
up the list. He knew this by two tokens.
One was the speculative look he surprised on
Larry Keys’ countenance. The other was the fact
that when Larry, who had succeeded Pete Ness at
right half, went out in the second session of the
scrimmage game Jake’s summons was: “Hollins!
Go in at left half, boy!”</p>

<p>He played some six minutes that day, remembering
better now to keep his head up and look
for the opening. Once that proceeding served him
well, for on an off-tackle play something went
wrong and his own full-back and the opposing end
were blocking the hole. Seeing it in time, he sped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
on out, closely pursued by the Scrub left end, side-stepped
an enemy back and went around for seven
yards. Then he stood and listened while Coach
Cade made a few critical remarks to Oscar Couch.
The First took revenge to-day for yesterday’s 6
to 6 tie, piling up three touchdowns on the enemy.
One of these was put across while Bert was in,
and, although it was Couch who took the ball over,
Bert had a fine part in the conquest of those last
eight yards and felt as triumphant as any one
when, the heap of bodies having been disentangled,
the pigskin was found to be well across the mark.</p>

<p>That afternoon Fitz Savell had another try at
end, left this time, and Joe Tate looked extremely
worried during the experiment. There was no
doubt that Savell had the making of a brilliant
end-rush, although since that position seemed well
supplied with talent there was no apparent reason
for sacrificing a good backfield man. Finally Tate
was restored to his place and Fitz was later seen
at left half once more. Returning to Upton from
the gymnasium after practice, Chick voiced uneasiness
to Bert. “Wonder what Johnny’s idea is
in letting Fitz play end. The man’s a half-back
and a mighty good one, and it would be a queer
piece of business to try to make an end of him in
the middle of the season. Anyway, we’ve got four
good ends right now.”</p>

<p>“Who’s the fourth?” asked Bert. “Tate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Shelfer and Kruger, sure, but who’s the other?”</p>

<p>Chick grinned. “Your Uncle Dudley, son. Of
course I oughtn’t to call myself good, but you’ll
excuse it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Bert, suddenly serious, “you
are good, Chick, when you want to be, but it seems
to me that you haven’t been up to your real form
this fall. Not always, I mean.”</p>

<p>Chick looked affronted for a moment. Then he
laughed. “What’s the idea, Bert?” he asked.
“Think I’m getting a swelled head, or what?”</p>

<p>“No, but I mean it, Chick. I supposed you knew
it, too, or I wouldn’t have mentioned it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come,” protested Chick, “don’t lay it on!
I don’t say I’ve always played at top-notch. No
fellow can, I guess. But I’ve kept my end up as
well as any of them, haven’t I?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Bert. “I may be wrong, of
course. Only it has seemed to me that you—well,
that you don’t try as hard as you did, Chick; don’t
take as much interest in the game. Perhaps I
imagine it. Anyway, you mustn’t get sore because
I spoke about it.”</p>

<p>“Sore! Of course not.” But he did sound a
trifle irritated. “I thought I’d been playing a
pretty good article of football, old scout, and your
information is rather jarring. Any one tell you
this, or did you just discover it for yourself?”
Chick’s eyes narrowed suspiciously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“My own idea entirely,” replied Bert lightly.
“I dare say I’m not a competent judge of how end
position should be played. Of course, Chick, I
want to see you playing way ahead of every one
and so I’m probably over-critical. You know how
you’re playing better than I do.”</p>

<p>“I’d ought to,” agreed Chick. Then, when they
were in the room, he reverted to the subject.
“Funny idea of yours,” he mused. “Thinking
I’m off my game, I mean.” He laughed uneasily.
“Hope Johnny doesn’t catch it! Fact is, Bert, I
haven’t been feeling quite as peppy as I ought to
so far this fall. Maybe it sort of shows in my playing,
eh? I don’t believe it, though. I’ll bet I’ve
played just as good a game as Joe Tate right
along. Don’t you think I have?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know, Chick. I’ve said I’m no
judge of how end ought to be played. Last year, if
you’ll remember, you played a better game than
Joe, a whole lot better.”</p>

<p>“That means you don’t think I have, eh? I
don’t see how you figure it. Take last Saturday,
for instance—”</p>

<p>“I won’t do it,” laughed Bert. “If you say
you’re playing up to top form that’s all there is to
it, Charles.”</p>

<p>“Top form? Of course I’m not. No fellow
reaches top form as early in the season as this.
All I do say is that I’m doing just as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Joe or any other end! And if Johnny thinks he
can scare me by bluffing with Fitz Savell he’s
wrong!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he had anything like that in
mind,” said Bert. “Fitz is too good a back to turn
into an end. Tell you what, Chick. Cut out the
pool for the rest of this week, get to bed on time
and then see if you don’t feel a lot zippier!”</p>

<p>“Oh, piffle! How is playing a little pool going
to affect my football? Don’t be an ass, Bert!
Anyway, I’ve got a date with Les Devore for to-morrow
night. Maybe I’ll quit for a while after
that. Got to recoup my losses first, though! That
guy has certainly been putting the harpoon into me
lately!”</p>

<p>“Did you lose again last night?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t exactly win. That fellow’s
middle name is Lucky, Bert!”</p>

<p>“I guess it must be. Pretty good reason for
letting him alone for a while, isn’t it? I mean a
fellow can buck against a better game, Chick, but
a run of luck is something else.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s so,” agreed Chick thoughtfully.
“When we started playing I could beat him two
times out of three, but now, with everything breaking
his way, I’m doing well if I get one game in
four. But, heck, his luck can’t last! And when it
stops, believe me, Bert, I’m going to lay him
out stiff!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d lay off awhile and give the luck a chance
to catch up,” said Bert lightly.</p>

<p>“Yes, maybe I’d better,” muttered Chick.
“After to-morrow.”</p>

<p>What happened at Mooney’s Wednesday night
Bert didn’t learn. He was asleep when Chick returned,
and since the latter made no mention of
the previous evening’s events when morning came
Bert didn’t inquire. Chick seemed in good spirits,
whistling while he dressed, but Bert more than half
suspected that much of the gayety was assumed.
As a matter of fact, Chick was not the sort to
arise from bed blithe and singing. It usually took
him ten minutes to get his eyes thoroughly open,
and during that period he was more the bear with
the sore head than the nightingale! So if Chick
whistled with intent to deceive he selected the
wrong method.</p>

<p>Bert was rather too taken up with his own
affairs for the rest of that week to pay very much
attention to Chick’s, nevertheless he did make
note of the fact that neither on Thursday nor Friday
evenings did Chick resort to Mooney’s. Evidently
then Chick had decided to act on Bert’s
suggestion and allow Mr. Lester Devore’s phenomenal
luck at pool to become exhausted. Perhaps,
too, although he had not accepted Bert’s
hint with much enthusiasm, Chick thought it wise
to take no chances. Certain it was that he got to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
bed both nights by ten o’clock, or almost, and that
his performances on the gridiron seemed animated
by more vim.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bert discovered that from an unimportant
third substitute he had advanced in the
period of a few days to the rôle of a player of consequence.
Perhaps the degree of consequence
wasn’t great, but certain it was that he never
failed to get into the scrimmage line-up and that
Coach Cade, suddenly and rather disconcertingly
aware of his existence, gave him a good deal of
attention. The attention was sometimes embarrassing,
as when on Wednesday afternoon Bert
balled a play all up and found himself on his back
with two of the enemy kneeling on his diaphragm
and the pigskin, tightly clasped, some six yards
back of the point it had started from. Bert had
heard of coaches who became tempestuous and
profane under less provocation, but Mr. Cade was
not one of them. Mr. Cade might raise his voice
a note or two, but he never lost control of it—or
of himself. He didn’t even call names; that is,
not hard names. He might refer in a gentlemanly
manner to a fellow’s apparent lack of mentality
and address him as a “poor goat,” or he might,
in cases where a lineman failed to show sufficient
aggression, use the allowable term “loafer.” But
such appellations left no smart. However, it is
not to be assumed from this that Mr. Cade was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
tongue-tied. Not a bit of it. He had a surprising
command of the English language and a remarkable
fluency in the use of it. He also displayed a
positive genius in the correct choice of words. If
one could only remain sufficiently detached, as it
were, during one of Johnny’s best orations one
could without a doubt vastly improve one’s
rhetoric.</p>

<p>But remaining detached was difficult, and on the
occasion alluded to Bert profited not a whit in the
matter of increasing his vocabulary or perfecting
his speech. He did, however, profit in another
way. After Mr. Cade had lucidly and in detail explained
your mistake, you didn’t make that particular
mistake again. Oh, you might turn right
around and make another, but not that one! No,
sir, never again; or, anyway, not for a long, long
time! Bert’s ears got very warm and he looked
so long and steadily at Johnny’s old sweater that
he could have drawn a plan of it weeks later and
located every hole exactly. Then suddenly the call-down
was over and Mr. Cade was saying cheerfully:
“All right, First! Let’s go now, and stop
fooling! Let’s have a first down!”</p>

<p>But of course Bert wasn’t the only one to incur
the coach’s displeasure. Even as experienced a
hand as Nip Storer got his on one occasion. Bert,
standing by while play ceased, felt sympathetic
for Nip, but his sympathy was evidently misplaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
since, as soon as Johnny had ended, Nip turned
away with a jovial wink. Well, perhaps after you
had played two years you got hardened, Bert
thought. But as for him, he was still subdued.
Chick was on the carpet, also, once, and to Bert it
seemed that Mr. Cade’s voice was just a trifle
colder than before. Chick never took any too
kindly to criticism, even from the coach, and he
looked slightly contemptuous, slightly mutinous
during the proceeding. Bert wished he wouldn’t,
for Mr. Cade could not fail to notice it, and Bert
was fearful that the coach had already set down
more than one black mark against Chick.</p>

<p>Thursday there were no misadventures for Bert.
He even scored a mild triumph by breaking away
from the congested area after a delayed pass and
streaking something over thirty yards into the less
populated section of the field. He might have kept
on and quite lost himself in the vast open spaces
around the Second Team’s goal line if a pesky
long-legged youth named Simpkins hadn’t pursued
him and eventually attached himself to his legs.
Bert never had liked the name of Simpkins, and
to-day he liked it less than ever. On Friday the
work-out was light and confined principally to the
essentials. But the Scrub paid a brief visit and indulged
the First Team substitutes in a ten-minute
scrimmage. Because of the dismissal of the regulars,
Bert found himself starting the trouble at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
right half-back, with Tolman beside him and
“Ben” Franklin playing full-back. That wasn’t
much of a contest, for the Second took things into
her own hands and marched up the field after the
kick-off in a disgustingly irresistible manner, pushing
the opposition contemptuously aside and
eventually scoring without once losing possession.
Bert, among others, was used rather roughly, and
on one occasion caused a cessation of hostilities
while Jake soused him with water and pumped air
into his lungs. Such occasions can be extremely
unpleasant while they last, but once over leave no
painful effects, and consequently Bert was both
surprised and indignant when Jake, in charge because
Mr. Cade had accompanied the regulars to
the gymnasium, a few moments later called him
out. Not being in such awe of the trainer as he
was of the coach, Bert voiced his indignation when
he reached the side-line.</p>

<p>“What’s the idea, Jake?” he remonstrated.
“I’m all right! Losing your breath isn’t anything
to stop playing for!”</p>

<p>Jake viewed him with a cold and fishy eye and
spoke briefly. “Shut your trap,” said Jake.</p>

<p>Well, after that there was just one thing to do,
and Bert did it. He shut his trap.</p>

<p>Scrub threatened a second time, but lost the
ball when Parkhurst intercepted a forward-pass
and had to be satisfied with her six points. Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the session had been but half-length, casualties
were heavy on both sides, with the First
Team substitutes receiving the lion’s share of the
injuries. None of them was serious, but they were
uncomfortable enough to engender resentment, and
back in the gymnasium, already deserted by the
regulars, acrimonious debate ensued up and down
the aisles between the lockers. Bert, still feeling
rather outraged because of the way in which he
had been treated by the Scrub, and indignant because
Jake had pulled him out in the middle of the
fight, was not in a mood for ragging. So, when
Laidlaw, a Scrub end, referred to an occasion
when Bert had failed to stop his mad career, Bert
resented it. One word led to another, a shoe was
thrown, a bench was overturned, an appreciative
audience, forgetting its own disputes, closed about
and Bert had the extreme satisfaction of knocking
Laidlaw to the floor in something under sixty
seconds. Laidlaw, undaunted if staggered, would
have continued the engagement, but Jake issued
wrathfully forth from the rubbing room and made
remarks which indicated that the bout didn’t have
his sanction. So the audience, jeering good-naturedly,
dispersed, leaving Bert to fondle a
swelling chin and Laidlaw to staunch a flowing
nose. Then Bert came on Laidlaw’s shoe and
politely if coldly returned it to him, and Laidlaw
said “Thanks” very gravely and departed to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
shower. And ten minutes later, meeting on the
way out, they both grinned and, without a word
uttered, parted somewhat better friends than before.</p>

<p>The next morning the Alton Team piled into
two busses and hit the trail for Lorimer, while the
School cheered the departure and prepared to
follow later by train. Bert sat beside Chick and
was secretly very elated and somewhat excited.
Last season, although he had witnessed every
game that Alton had played away from home, he
had never made the journey with the Team. If
proof was lacking of his new status on the Eleven
this happening supplied it. Here he was, with
Captain Jonas, large and good-humoredly taciturn,
but two seats away, Chick at his right shoulder
and Hop Meecham at his left, really and truly,
positively and absolutely at last one of the gang!
The October morning was gray and chill, with
a suggestion of mist at intervals, but Bert didn’t
know that the sun wasn’t shining!</p>

<small>CHICK MISSES A FORWARD-PASS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Lorimer presented a hefty team that afternoon,
one that outweighed Alton in the line and equaled
her in the backfield. And it was a hard-fighting,
aggressive and shifty team as well. It didn’t display
a great variety of plays, but what it showed
it knew remarkably well and used to advantage.
Lorimer’s best ground-gainer was a sweep from
kick formation, a play which started slowly enough
but gathered momentum rapidly and, when it
reached the line, had all the power of a war tank.
The interference was well placed and effective,
the runner being concealed until well past his end
and after that nicely protected by a moving wall
of players. All through the first half of the game,
whenever Lorimer used that sweep she gained,
sometimes many yards—especially when her full-back
carried—and sometimes only a few. Toward
the end of the second quarter it was less effective,
since the secondary defense had learned to concentrate
on the runner and pay no heed to the interference
as long as the play went toward the
side-line, but even up to the last it was good for
some slight gain. Since Lorimer sent off passes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
slid off tackle, plunged at the center and kicked
from that one formation the visitor was kept busy
guessing what was coming. And not infrequently
she guessed wrong.</p>

<p>The first score came as a result of a fumble on
the part of the home team’s quarter on Alton’s
thirty-six yards. Billy Haines dived through on
the pigskin and Jim Galvin, on the first play,
romped clean through the Lorimer center for
twelve yards. But Jim wasn’t able to repeat that
stunt, and the ball went slowly to Lorimer’s forty-one
and a first down, Jim and Nip Storer alternating
on the tackles. Then Alton tried a sweep
herself and, while the play lacked the finish of the
enemy’s performance, Pete Ness swung through
for seven yards. Pete made four more and first
down again on a criss-cross outside tackle. Lorimer
braced at her thirty-yard line and two downs
went for less than that many yards. Storer went
back to kicking position, but he tossed the ball over
the line to Joe Tate who, although downed where
he had caught, added four yards. Nip Storer
tried to put the ball over on a drop-kick, but it went
short and rolled over the line. Lorimer kicked
high and Ted Ball made a fair catch on the
enemy’s forty-seven. Ted carried the ball sixteen
yards on a wide end run and Jim Galvin hit the
line twice and reached the twenty-five yards.
With four to go on third down, Ted passed to Nip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and Nip hurled twenty yards to Chick. But Chick
failed to quite get into position and the ball
grounded. <a href="#image03">On the next attempt</a>, standing just inside
the thirty-five-yard line, <a href="#image03">Nip put the ball over

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_127">On the next attempt Nip put the ball over the cross-bar</a></div>
</div>

<p>There was no more scoring until just before the
end of the half. Then Lorimer, who had twice
plugged her way well into Alton territory, the first
time to lose the ball on a fumble, found herself on
the enemy’s twenty-eight on first down. That
sweep play netted a scant three yards and placed
the pigskin close to a side-line. A four yard smash
straight through Captain Lowe followed. Then,
with three yards to go, Lorimer prepared for a
placement kick. The angle was extreme and Alton
warned against a fake. When the ball went back
to the quarter that youth arose from the ground
and passed across to a running end, and the end
scampered off and around the Alton right for half
the distance to the goal before Jim Galvin thumped
him down. From the ten yards, although the
Gray-and-Gold contested every foot of the ground,
Lorimer pushed steadily forward, finally thrusting
a back through on fourth down for a scant yard
and the coveted touchdown. Goal was missed.</p>

<p>When play was resumed after the intermission
there was but one change in either line-up, and
that change was the substitution of Thomas for
Dozier at left tackle on the Alton team. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
changes came, but they were few and occurred
mostly in the final period, by which time it seemed
fairly apparent that Alton was destined to be on
the short end of a 9 to 6 score. Each team added
a field-goal in the third quarter, Alton following
Ted Ball’s forty-two-yard gallop to Lorimer’s
twenty; Lorimer after she had pulled down
Storer’s short punt in the center of the field and
desperately worked down to the thirty-one. Lorimer’s
placement goal from the forty-yard line was
one of the few outstanding features of the game.
To be sure the ball was directly in front of the
goal, but even so forty yards is a long distance for
an eighteen-year-old foot to accomplish, and after
their first instant of consternation some two hundred
Alton supporters applauded generously. Another
outstanding feature of the contest was seen
some two minutes before play ended and was
hailed with far less acclaim by the visitors.</p>

<p>Mr. Cade had begun to relieve the more wearied
of his players, and the line-up showed half a dozen
new faces. Captain Jonas, however, was still in,
and so were the first-string ends, Joe Tate and
Chick. Lorimer, too, had introduced fresh material,
even more lavishly, and Alton, after receiving
a punt on her thirty-nine yards, was trying
desperately to tie or win. Fitz Savell twice
worked himself loose for short runs and Couch,
who had taken Galvin’s place, ripped a hole in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
left of the enemy line and romped through for
eight yards before he was smothered. Keys failed
to gain from the Lorimer forty-three, and Couch
faked a forward and then tried the Lorimer left
and gathered in almost enough to win a first down.
Savell added the necessary yard and then, on the
subsequent effort, once more shook off the enemy
and reached Lorimer’s twenty-two. There the
enemy stiffened and, after two unsuccessful attempts
by Couch and Keys, and with the sands of
time running low, Couch went back to kicking position.
He wasn’t much of a goal kicker, and, although
he was standing inside the thirty yards,
those in the Alton section of the stand, even while
they shouted hoarsely for victory, had little hope
of a score. What they did hope was that, since
this was only third down, Couch or some one
else would try a forward-pass before risking all
on a kick. And, lo, that is just what Couch did
try.</p>

<p>Taking the pigskin on a pass from center, he retreated
to the right, poising the ball in a generous
hand, and, at the last instant of safety hurled it
down the field to where Chick lurked unnoticed of
the defenders. The throw was well-nigh perfect
and covered all of twenty-five yards, and Chick
had only to step back a pace to get it, and, having
got it, need only leap across a scant ten yards to
turn defeat into victory. Alton started her pæan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of triumph while the pigskin still spun lazily in its
flight, while Lorimer visioned defeat and sought
desperately to reach the unguarded receiver.
Chick had his heroic moment then, poised steady
and confident in the path of the ball. Doubtless
every faculty was alert, every nerve tense. And
yet success slipped through his fingers or bounded
out of them! The watchers would have sworn that
he had the ball safe, that he had turned to run,
and yet in the next instant the ball was a free
agent, arching maliciously beyond his frantic
clutching! It struck the ground, went bobbing
across the side-line, and some two hundred mouths,
vocal a second before, remained open but empty
of sound!</p>

<p>And from somewhere half-way up the stand
came a familiar voice in tones audible on the gridiron.
“You’ve got to hold it, Chick,” called
Tommy Parish, “or it’ll get away from you!
Guess nobody told you that!”</p>

<p>Couch made a hopeless try at a goal from the
thirty yards, failed miserably and the ball went
to Lorimer. There was no more.</p>

<p>Bert, who in spite of bright expectations, had
viewed the game through from the substitute’s
bench, went dejectedly toward the dressing room.
Every one was unusually silent. He was careful
not to look around lest he encounter Chick’s eyes.
He wasn’t ready to look at Chick yet. He wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to show sympathy when he did look, and just now
he was too disgusted and downhearted.</p>

<p>Going back to Alton wasn’t as bad as Bert had
feared it would be. By common consent the game
was avoided as a matter for present conversation.
Mr. Cade appeared unaffected by the recent defeat
and talked unconcernedly with Coles Wistar much
of the way home regarding arrangements for the
next trip away, a fortnight distant. After Lorimer
had been left well behind the spirits of the
fellows lightened and one even heard laughter, although
it wasn’t very hearty yet. Chick’s attitude
surprised and perplexed Bert. Bert thought
that if he had been the one who had fumbled that
pass he would be trying to hide under a seat.
Chick, however, seemed to have forgotten the incident
entirely and was in and out of the conversation
about him as cheerfully as any. Perhaps
there were others in the bus who considered
Chick’s manner unusual, but Bert could see no
indication of it. Well, he did surprise Captain
Jonas once in a long and contemplative regard of
Chick, but Jonas’s countenance conveyed no emotion.
Of course there was no use in crying over
spilled milk, reflected Bert, and perhaps a fellow
was wise not to let misfortune prey on his mind,
but, just the same, he felt that Chick was overdoing
the composure.</p>

<p>Even after they were alone in Number 21<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Chick’s nonchalant air continued. Bert was glad
that they were obliged to hurry over to supper, for
he was beginning to experience intense exasperation
and was certain that if he remained alone with
Chick very long he would say something offensive.
Not a few of the students were still absent from
dining hall when Bert followed Chick over to the
training table, and the former was eager to credit
the lack of hand-clapping to that fact. None of
the players got much applause that evening, although
Captain Jonas and Lum Patten, entering
late, received fair acclaim. Mr. Cade was not in
his place at the head of the table and Andy Dozier
said he had taken a taxi and hustled over to the
Junction to get an early train home.</p>

<p>“Wish I could,” sighed Hop Meecham. “We
have baked beans and fish-balls at our house Sunday
mornings; and flannel cakes and syrup, too,
generally.” Hop’s countenance assumed a look
of intense longing.</p>

<p>“Know what I think?” asked Nip Storer, sinking
his voice. “I think Johnny’s got a girl! I
was in his room two or three days ago and there’s
a whacking big picture of a dame on his mantel
that wasn’t there last year. I’ll bet he’s going to
get married, fellows!”</p>

<p>The theory aroused interest at that end of the
long table. “Sure as shooting!” said Ted Ball.
“That’s why he’s going to quit, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“If he is,” doubted Billy Haines. “Me, I think
that’s just bunk.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t. You hear it everywhere. Say,
what’s the girl look like, Nip?”</p>

<p>“Some queen, kid! Sort of proud-looking, you
know, like one of those movie dames.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know that I’d be very keen about hitching
up with Johnny if I was a girl,” said Dozier.
“Bet you he will make her toe the mark.”</p>

<p>“Take the bet,” scoffed Ted. “She’ll gentle him
in a week! Say, I had a cousin who was a major
in the World War and got four decorations and
citations and things and was a holy terror over
there. Killed ’em single-handed or lugged ’em
in over his shoulder, a couple at a time. Some boy
he was! Well, what happened to him four years
ago? Why, he met a girl who just reached up to
the place where he parked his medals and married
her. Some one went by their place about two
months after they got settled and blamed if the
Major wasn’t out in the back-yard beating a carpet!”</p>

<p>“‘The bigger they are the harder they fall,’”
chuckled Nip. “Say, Johnny will be a regular find
when it comes to house cleaning. With that bristle
head of his his wife can clean every rug in the
house. And when it comes to getting the soot out
of the stovepipes!”</p>

<p>“Aw, shut up,” growled Billy Haines. “He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
isn’t going to get married and he isn’t going to
quit. Bet you that picture’s his sister.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure,” jeered Nip, “a fellow always puts
his sister’s photo in a ten-dollar frame and sticks
it on the mantel, doesn’t he? Yes, he does—like
fun! Sis gets chucked in the bottom drawer somewhere!”</p>

<p>“You tell ’em, you Sunday Sheik,” said
Meecham. “Your knowledge of such matters, Nip,
makes me fairly shudder!”</p>

<p>Nip threatened him with a salt-cellar, and, encountering
the interested regard of Mr. Metcalfe,
from a near-by table, sprinkled his slice of toast
and apple-butter lavishly before setting the cellar
down.</p>

<p>Bert lost track of Chick after supper. He
thought he knew where he was to be found, but he
didn’t seek him. Instead, he dropped into Bus
Lovell’s room and later accompanied Bus and four
other youths to a moving picture theater on the
far side of town. The picture was pretty bad, but
they managed to have plenty of fun.</p>

<p>On Sunday a verse of alleged poetry was going
the rounds. Tommy Parish was credited with the
authorship, but he refused to acknowledge it. I
grieve to say that Bert saw it first in church when,
during the sermon, Toby Shelfer slipped him a
piece of paper on which was scrawled: “Seen this?
Read it and pass it on.</p>

<p>Coach Cade was back on Monday for dinner, and
to one or two especially observant members of the
squad he looked more grim and determined than
usual. Instead of sending the squad out to the
field at three-thirty that afternoon he talked to
them in the gymnasium for some twenty minutes.
First he took up Saturday’s game and went
through it exhaustively, pointing out mistakes and
short-comings. He started with center and worked
through guards, tackles, ends and backs, and it
was surprising how many faults he managed to
mention. Finally he said: “Now, fellows, I’m going
to talk plain. We are all in this together. If
I fail in my duties it affects you, and if you fail it
comes back on me. You want to win your games
and I want you to, and if you’re to do it you and
I have got to team up and pull side by side from
now on. There’s no getting around the fact that
so far we’ve made a poor showing. You will have
to look back over the Alton football records for
many years before you’ll find a season as disappointing
as this has been so far. We’ve played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
four games and won just one. Not only that but,
against pretty weak teams, we’ve managed to
score only 40 points to the opponents’ 31. You
don’t need to have me tell you that there’s something
wrong somewhere. I wish I could tell you
what it is, but I can’t. I’m willing to assume half
the responsibility, though, for I have a hunch that
I know one way in which I’ve failed this fall. I’ll
take that up in a minute. What I’m getting at now
is that it’s up to all of us to face the situation and
determine to get the best of it. It’s a time for
drastic measures, and I want you to realize it. We
can’t defeat Kenly Hall if we keep on the way
we’re going. I’m certain of that, and those of
you who have played here in other seasons know it
too. All right, then. We’ve got to stop taking
things for granted and prove them. That’s what
we’ve been doing, fellows, taking things for
granted. Both of us. That’s the mistake I spoke
of a minute ago. You are taking it for granted
that you’re going to be able to play winning football
when you get up against Kenly. Probably
you know yourselves capable of it. I think you
are capable of it. I’m taking it for granted, too.
That is, I have been. Beginning to-day, though,
I’m not.”</p>

<p>He paused and looked over the half circle of
puzzled faces before he continued. “Beginning
to-day, fellows, no one is going to hold a position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
on this team because he filled it last season, or because
he thinks himself entitled to it through previous
service, or because he shows promise. Nor
for any other reason save just one, which is that he
proves conclusively to my satisfaction that he is
the best man for the job. This goes from top to
bottom, from Captain Lowe to the greenest man on
the squad. Captain Lowe may be the best man for
the right guard position; probably he is; but he’s
got to show us, you and me both. So on right
through the line-up. You may be all you think you
are, all you ought to be, all I’ve been accepting you
as, but, by golly, you’ve got to prove it. No position
is sacred any longer, fellows. If Smith wants
Jones’ job all he’s got to do is go and get it. It’s
his if he can play a better brand of football than
Jones. Theoretically this has always been the
rule here, this year as well as other years, just as
it is the general rule at other schools and colleges.
Actually, however, it hasn’t been working very
thoroughly, and that’s my fault. Some of you
have—well, hypnotized is the best word I can think
of—have hypnotized me into accepting you at your
own valuation, into thinking as you do that you
own your positions. Well, yesterday I woke up. I
saw that I’d been taking far too much for granted.
Here’s where I stop being an easy mark, fellows.
And here’s where all mortgages are canceled.
How’s that hit you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the countenances before him looked
rather dazed, others showed grins, but no one replied
for an instant. Then Captain Lowe said
calmly: “Suits me, Coach!” And other murmured
agreements followed.</p>

<p>“Good! We’ve got material here plenty good
enough to build a winning team out of, fellows.
Let’s do it. Let’s start to-day and build from the
bottom up. There’s time enough. The material’s
seasoned, only the arrangement will be new. Wistar,
got a sheet of paper handy? All right. Put
down the names of the fellows, all of them, and
classify them as usual: linemen, ends, backs; and
let me have the list when we go out. There’s one
more thing I want to speak of. There’s been far
too much fumbling going on. A certain amount of
it’s to be expected at this season, but we’ve been
overdoing it. Saturday’s game was lost through
a fumble, and there were two others which, while
recovered fortunately enough, shouldn’t have
occurred. I want to get rid of that stuff, and if
necessary I’ll go back to a half-hour of passing
every afternoon. But I think it’s possible to cure
weak fingers in another way. You’ll remember
how in the poem of The Ancient Mariner the man
who shot the albatross had it tied around his neck
as punishment. Well, I propose to adopt a somewhat
similar plan. After this too many fumbles
will result in the offender carrying a football<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
around with him wherever he goes: classes, meals,
off the campus, everywhere; and at night it will
sit beside him on a chair at the head of his bed.
This isn’t an original idea; it’s been tried before;
but I think it ought to work. Will you fellows
agree to it and make it effective?”</p>

<p>Agreement was hearty. The idea amused them
and, since the discourse had hitherto been too
serious to allow of levity, they laughed uproariously.
Mr. Cade smiled, too, but the smile was
rather grim.</p>

<p>“That’s all, fellows,” he said. “Let’s go out
and make up for lost time.”</p>

<p>That afternoon practice went off as usual on a
Monday, with the accent on formation drill and the
players in Saturday’s game being excused thereafter.
The Second Team engaged a team of substitutes
and won handily in two ten-minute
periods. Bert played right half in the first period
and gave way to Keys in the second. Neither of
them performed any deeds calculated to raise their
stock, yet Bert found encouragement in the fact
that Coach Cade had selected him to start the
scrimmage. That made it look as if in the coach’s
estimation he and Keys were about on a par.</p>

<p>A rather garbled and exaggerated version of
Mr. Cade’s remarks circulated about school that
evening, and the reactions were varied. Many
dubbed the scheme as suicidal, declaring it too late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
in the season to start a reorganization of the team.
Others favored the plan, sometimes remarking
vindictively that it would serve some of those
swelled-heads about right if they lost their positions.
Then still others met the news with a pessimistic
shrug. It didn’t much matter, they thought,
what Coach Cade did. In any event the team was
too rotten to be saved and another defeat at the
hands of Kenly Hall was inevitable.</p>

<p>Tommy Parish got the tidings from his room-mate,
Billy Pillsbury. Pill was much excited and
predicted disaster. Tommy said: “Soak your
head, Pill. Johnny’s got the right idea at last. I
was wondering how long it would take him to tumble
to himself.”</p>

<p>Pill stared incredulously. “Aw, get out,
Tommy! You never thought of it! I suppose
you’ll be saying next thing that you suggested it
to Johnny!”</p>

<p>Tommy shrugged. “No, I didn’t suggest it to
him, but I might have. All fall fellows like Andy
Dozier and Hop Meecham and others I could name
have been sitting pretty and doing just enough to
get by. They sure had Johnny buffaloed! They
couldn’t have done it another season, but this year
Johnny has too much on his mind.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” asked Pill, impressed in
spite of his determination not to be. “What’s he
got on his mind?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Tommy winked soberly. “A girl,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Oh, piffle! That’s just a yarn. Some fellow
saw a photograph on Johnny’s mantel and started
that stuff.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mister Wisenheimer, you know it all.
But you just wait and see. Pshaw, I know the
signs! I’ve got brothers and sisters, Pill, and I
know how they act when they’ve got the bug. It’s
fierce!”</p>

<p>“Well, even if that’s so,” said Pill, “Johnny’s
making a bull. You can’t make over a football
team right in the middle of the season. Gosh,
what do you suppose will happen if he gets to
monkeying with some of the guys? They’ll get
mad and quit on him cold!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you be alarmed,” answered Tommy
calmly. “There won’t be as many changes as you
might think, son. Let some of those fellows get
it into their beans that they’re going to lose their
positions if they don’t brace up and they’ll brace,
take it from me! Bet you there won’t be four
changes in the whole line-up between now and the
big game! What will happen, Pill, is that the
whole bunch of loafers will get onto themselves
and do an honest day’s work now and then! You
watch, young Pill.”</p>

<p>The immediate result was a rather different line-up
on Tuesday when scrimmage began. Kruger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
had Tate’s place at left end, Nat Wick was at left
guard in lieu of Meecham, Toby Shelfer played
right end, and Fitz Savell had Storer’s job at half-back.
As the game progressed other changes were
made. Howard went in for Haines at right tackle,
a practically unknown youth named Walsh sent
Jim Galvin out and Bert relieved Pete Ness at
right half. Nor was Mr. Cade through even then,
for, when the scrimmage was almost over, he
grabbed a tackle from the Scrubs and put him in
Andy Dozier’s place. Results were not easy to
judge, but at least the First showed more downright
fight than it had exhibited for some time.
It pushed the Scrub down the field for sixty yards
in the last period and finally hurled Walsh
through for a score. Since the Scrub had met
with a stronger resistance than usual that touchdown
represented the day’s scoring.</p>

<p>On Wednesday Mr. Cade used two teams against
the Second, one for each ten-minute period, and
each grabbed off a touchdown. Bert played right
through on the second line-up—it was difficult to
say whether it was Mr. Cade’s second choice or
his first, regulars and substitutes were so mixed
together—and got a nice thirty-yard romp on one
occasion that might have resulted in a score if Don
Riding, playing quarter, had not fumbled. Back
in the locker room that afternoon the expressions
of doubt and even consternation on some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
faces might have amused a disinterested bystander.
Jake, the trainer, came nearest to that
character, and Jake smiled more than once while
he administered to contusions and strains and listened
to the talk.</p>

<p>It became noised about on Thursday that Mr.
Cade would pick the team to play Oak Grove according
to the performances that afternoon, and
not even Tommy Parish could—or did—complain
of indifference or lassitude on the part of the candidates.
Some of the regulars—or those who had
been regulars—moved around with the nervous,
anxious alacrity of new hands, trying to impress
the coach with their energy and ambition against
the time when the line-up for the scrimmage with
the Scrub should be announced. Even Captain
Jonas looked almost perturbed at moments. He
had heartily agreed to Mr. Cade’s plan, but he
sometimes wished he hadn’t. Jonas wasn’t used
to trying to impress folks as being eager and full
of pep! It came hard!</p>

<p>Mr. Cade drove the First hard that afternoon,
and almost every fellow on the squad saw service
before the end. Second was given the ball on the
First’s thirty-yard line a number of times and
told to rush it, field-goals being barred. Once the
Scrub scored on a short pass over the line, but the
other times she was forced to yield the ball short of
the goal. She was on her mettle to-day and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
First Team linemen underwent some hard knocks.
For that matter, so did the backs, for there was
a weak place on the left of the line that continued
all during the scrimmage, and more than once it
was the secondary defense that stopped the runner.
Bert played for some six or eight minutes in
the last period, and, although First was showing
what she could do on attack during most of that
time, he was used pretty roughly and finally
emerged with a fine large welt under one eye. As
an exhibition of playing Thursday’s performance
was distinctly encouraging, but as an indication of
what Saturday’s line-up was to be it was a failure.
Even on Friday the coach used three or four
men for every position, and surprised his charges
by staging a fifteen-minute scrimmage against the
Scrub. Certainly Oak Grove was not a fearsome
opponent, but such hard work the day before a
game was well-nigh unprecedented. It was on
Friday that Bert flashed for an instant when, pulling
down a twelve-yard forward-pass over the
right of the line, he squirmed and fought onward
for sixteen more before superior weight and numbers
brought him down. In that run he showed a
really remarkable ability for eluding tacklers and
throwing off tackles, for he went through half a
dozen of the enemy and squirmed away from
others like a greased pig. And yet, some two
minutes later, when the same play was repeated he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
failed badly at getting into position for the catch
and the ball was plucked out of the air by the
Scrub full-back. Fortune, it seemed, was a fickle
goddess!</p>

<p>Chick was difficult to live with during the closing
days of that week, for he had been spending
much of his time on the bench and resented it bitterly.
Bert’s reminder that a lot of the others
were faring the same way and that, once Mr. Cade
got through experimenting, they’d probably all be
back in place again failed of the soothing effect it
was designed to produce. Chick didn’t think well
of experiments, and said so in unmistakable language.
“What’s it getting him?” he demanded
that Friday evening. “He’s tried Shelfer and
Nast and Savell, and not one of them has played
the position as well as I do. Oh, maybe Savell,
yes, but he’s not such a wonder on defense. He
got boxed finely a couple of times to-day. Johnny
will put me back there finally, and he knows it
plaguy well, so what’s the use of letting me miss
practice? I haven’t been in once when that Number
14 play was tried. They’ll use it to-morrow
and then wonder what’s wrong if I don’t get the
right man!”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he’s in earnest about Fitz
Savell,” said Bert. “He wouldn’t spoil a corking
good back.”</p>

<p>“Of course not! Then what’s the good of making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
believe? He’s just losing time. The whole
truth of the matter is that Johnny’s up in the air
and doesn’t know what to do about it. So he’s
just fiddling around in the hope that he will light
on something. If he would teach us about four
good scoring plays and quit monkeying with his delayed
passes and fake kicks we’d deliver the goods,
I’ll bet!”</p>

<p>“That Number 14 looks pretty good, though,
Chick. It fooled the Scrub all right yesterday
and to-day.”</p>

<p>“The Scrub? Sure! But just let him try it
against a wide-awake team like Mt. Millard a week
from now. Why, they’ll eat it up, Bert! There’s
nothing new about it. It’s old stuff to them, I’ll
bet.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t new,” said Bert, “but I heard Ted
say that it has new features.”</p>

<p>“Tackle coming around and going through with
the two halfs may be new, but I don’t believe it
makes the play any better. Besides, what’s the
idea of working it from a shift? You can do the
same thing from regular formation. Shucks, I’ve
been seeing that old trick ever since I was knee-high!”</p>

<p>“I guess what you can call new plays aren’t to
be had any more, Chick.” Bert was glad enough
to argue this matter out if only to keep Chick
away from his grievance. “Most everything’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
been done already, and about all a coach can hope
to do is dress an old play up in new togs so it’ll
look like a stranger. I don’t believe Johnny will
let us use that Number 14 to-morrow, anyway. I
think he’s going to save it for Kenly.”</p>

<p>“He’s pretty sure to try it on Mt. Millard, because
Mt. Millard will take a lot of licking, old
scout. And I’ll bet Mt. Millard will love it to
death, too! Anyway, if he does use it to-morrow
it won’t be my fault if I flub it. He hasn’t worked
me in it once.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t miss, Chick. Defending left
half’s your meat. All you do is block him off.”</p>

<p>“Just the same, I should have been in on it at
least once,” responded Chick, evidently determined
to be displeased. “No fellow can learn a
play just by watching it from the bench or tagging
along with the gallery!”</p>

<p>But, as it turned out, Chick needn’t have worried
himself, for the next afternoon at two-forty-five
Mr. Cade gave out the line-up for the Oak Grove
game and Chick wasn’t mentioned.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>THE EDITOR CALLS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>That line-up held some real surprises, and since it
was the line-up that, with but one change, continued
to the end of the season it may be well to set
it down here. Left End, Kruger; Left Tackle,
Thomas; Left Guard, Wick; Center, Patten; Right
Guard, Lowe; Right Tackle, Haines; Right End,
Savell; Quarter-Back, Ball; Left Half-Back,
Storer; Right Half-Back, Walsh; Full-Back, Galvin.</p>

<p>The re-forming of the whole left side of the line
was a distinct shock, although lessened by the
suspicion that the dumping of Tate and Dozier and
Meecham was only temporary. At any rate the
School entertained that suspicion, but the players
themselves were less optimistic. The placing of
Savell at right end was doubtless another experiment,
and the presence of an almost unknown like
Larry Walsh in the backfield was merely a wild
flight of fancy on the part of the coach. So at
least those in the stand explained the appearance
of the new claimants. On the bench, away from
the hearing of the coach, speculation was rife and
animated. The deposed ones generally accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
their fate philosophically and smiled. One of
them, though, was neither philosophical nor smiling.
Chick’s countenance portrayed a queer mingling
of puzzlement and resentment. Returning
from warming up with the second squad, Bert,
although the act savored of treachery, chose a seat
far removed from his chum. He felt very sorry
for Chick, but he knew that he had nothing in the
way of condolences that the other would listen to.</p>

<p>If Coach Cade was aware of the mild sensation
he had created there was nothing to indicate the
fact. He gave his final instructions in his usual
calm and cheerful manner and retired to an end
of the bench with Manager Wistar to observe results.
The results were not very startling. If he
or any one else had expected to witness a sudden
and radical change for the better in the playing
of the Alton team he was doomed to disappointment.
But probably he was experienced enough to
expect nothing of the sort. The first half of the
contest possibly vindicated his judgment, but it
resulted in only one score by the Gray-and-Gold,
a neat placement kick by Nip Storer. Oak Grove
put up only a fair grade of football, presenting
a rather decent defense but showing little in the
way of attack.</p>

<p>The left of the Alton line did well enough, although
it was evident that there was a lack of experience
there. Of the three new occupants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the positions Nat Wick created the best impression.
He was steady and shifty and helped his
center well on defense and was a big improvement
over Hop Meecham on attack. Fitz Savell performed
brilliantly, although the opposition was
not such as to make his work exceptional. Larry
Walsh failed to distinguish himself at any time
during the game, although he proved to be a hard-working,
plugging back who could be depended on
to make a short gain whenever he was used.
Walsh had played on the Second last season without
getting into the lime-light. He was a husky
youth, with plenty of weight and a shock of yellowish
hair which, when his head guard fell off, shone
like an oriflamme. In the last period it was Walsh
who wore down the defense and allowed Storer to
rip through for Alton’s third score and second
touchdown.</p>

<p>On the whole that was a dull contest, with Oak
Grove never threatening and Alton using some
eight or nine straight plays and relying on superior
kicking to keep her out of tight places.
Only two forward-passes were tried by Alton, and
both grounded. On her part, Oak Grove kept away
from the aerial game as far as her opponent until,
in the last period, desperation drove her to it. But
she had nothing in that line that deserved notice.
Usually her receiver failed to reach position and
the pass was incompleted, but once Savell took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the ball out of the air and got off a nice run of
twenty yards or so. Coach Cade made several
changes during the course of the contest and ran
in a handful of substitutes towards the end, and
altogether twenty-one players took part in administering
a 17 to 0 defeat to the visitor.</p>

<p>The School chose to regard the event as a notable
victory, and, although the pleas of the cheer
leaders during the game had elicited but little
cheering, there was a most flattering salvo of applause
to greet the players when they entered Lawrence
that evening. Perhaps the School was glad
of an opportunity to applaud and so made the
most of it. Coach Cade, breaking his usual custom
of returning to his home over Sunday, received
a lot of clapping and fervid “A-a-ays!” when he
appeared for supper, and must have been slightly
surprised thereby since it had been no secret to
him that the student body was somewhat critical
of his conduct of the team. Chick’s appetite was
small that evening, and he had little to say. He
appeared to have settled on cynical dignity as the
proper attitude, and maintained it throughout the
meal. Afterwards he disappeared with startling
abruptness, and Bert’s efforts to discover him in
any one of several rooms failed. Bert’s last port
of call was Number 5 Lykes, and there he remained
until late, in company with Ted Ball and Coles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Wistar and Nip Storer and Captain Jonas Lowe,
while the recent events were discussed fully and
with a frankness that would have interested Coach
Cade. The consensus of opinion was that Johnny
had done a brave if dastardly deed and that, pending
results, judgment should be reserved. And
Captain Jonas said stolidly: “’S long’s we beat
Kenly ’s all right with me!”</p>

<p>“You,” quoth Coles, “might be expected to view
the—er—affair philosophically, Jonas. You’re
not out of a job.”</p>

<p>Jonas grinned, but made no reply. Perhaps an
answer was brewing in his mind, but just then Hop
Meecham and Pete Ness stopped in with the cheering
news that Kenly Hall had been beaten by
Trinity Freshmen that afternoon, 14 to 6. “Just
came over the radio in Borden,” said Hop. “And
Yale beat the Army, and Notre Dame beat— Who
was it, Pete?”</p>

<p>“Canal Zone Polytechnic Institute, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up! Anyhow—”</p>

<p>“Sure about Kenly, though?” asked Nip
Storer. “I don’t know how good Trinity Freshmen
are, but I hope they’re rotten!”</p>

<p>“They sang off a lot of other scores, and I told
Pete to remember them, but I’ll bet he hasn’t,”
said Hop. “What were they, Dumb-bell?”</p>

<p>Pete shrugged. “All I remember is Mount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Millard and Banning, Mt. Millard won. I forget
the score: 26 to something, I think; maybe it was
26 to 14.”</p>

<p>“Who cares?” asked Ted Ball. “The question
interesting me is what’ll the score be next Saturday?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll win,” said Nip. “We can’t have
any more rotten luck!”</p>

<p>“I’d like to believe it,” answered Coles.</p>

<p>“Say,” asked Hop, “heard about the new club
just started? Called the Garbage Pail. Very exclusive.
Only five members so far. I’m president
and Pete’s secretary, or something. I’d be glad to
propose you guys only you’re not rotten enough—yet!”</p>

<p>“Johnny,” said Pete, “has just been elected to
Ornery Membership. It wouldn’t be a bad idea for
some of you chaps to fill out your applications
soon. You might be eligible in a day or two.”</p>

<p>“And that’s no Mother Goose tale!” said Nip.
“Every time Johnny looks my way I start to pull
my head guard off and write out my resignation.
Keep a place in the Pail for me, Hop!”</p>

<p>“Say, what about it, Cap?” asked Pete. “Are
we down-and-out, or is Johnny just having a joke
with us?”</p>

<p>“Guess he means it,” answered Jonas soberly.
“You fellows want to hump yourselves.”</p>

<p>“You watch me,” said Hop. “If Nat Wick gets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
my job for keeps that lad’s got to go some! Mind
you, I’m not blaming Johnny, either. I’m free to
confess that our side of the line’s been pretty punk,
and Andy Dozier and I had it coming to us. Joe,
too, I guess. As for Pete, every one knows how
rotten he’s been!”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” growled Pete.</p>

<p>“I thought I was playing a pretty nice game,”
went on Hop reflectively, “but I guess I wasn’t.
Anyhow, something was sure loose on that side
and maybe it was me. I’d hate like the deuce to
think I was dumped for good, though.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw,” said Coles, “Johnny means to have
you back there, Hop. As Jonas says, get out and
hump, son!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m going to hump,” Hop assured him.
“You won’t know me from a dromedary by Monday!”</p>

<p>Bert got back to Number 21 well before ten
o’clock and found an empty room. What time
Chick returned Bert never knew, but it was certainly
well after ten.</p>

<p>Sunday’s paper corroborated the radio announcement
of Kenly’s defeat, but since one of
the opponent’s touchdowns had been due to an
intercepted forward-pass in midfield and the other
scored in the last minute or two of the game, when
the Kenly Hall team had contained numerous substitutes,
there was less encouragement to be derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
from it. According to the correspondent’s
account of the affair Kenly had played better
football; although, as Chick pointed out when Bert
drew his attention to the statement, the correspondent
was naturally prejudiced.</p>

<p>Living with Chick that Sunday was a good deal
like being holed up with a disgruntled bear, Bert
secretly thought. And since it rained hard from
early dawn to darkness, there wasn’t much chance
of getting out of the hole for long. Church attendance
was canceled in the forenoon, at which
time the rain was descending in torrents and the
streets were rivers, and even at one o’clock nothing
save hunger would have taken Bert to Lawrence
Hall. Chick was a pessimist to-day. Not
an ordinary pessimist, either, but something exceptional,
a sort of hyper-super-pessimist. Nothing
was right for Chick. The weather was a personal
affront, the newspaper was dull, his fountain
pen was execrable, letter writing was a task invented
by the devil and having to go out for dinner
in the rain was a crime. Chick was pretty certain
that he would catch cold and die within a few days,
or so Bert gathered. Chick didn’t flare up over
any of the sorry tricks Fate was playing on him.
He was just morose and hopeless, abjectly, profoundly
hopeless. He didn’t seem to want to talk
on any subject that Bert could think of. And when
he wasn’t talking he managed to give Bert the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
that as a companion for a rainy day, he, Bert, was
a total loss!</p>

<p>Bert was heartily glad when Homer Johnson
came in after dinner and made a third. Homer
was Captain of the Baseball Team, and just at
first he made it appear that it was in that capacity
he had called, for he tried to get Chick to agree to
join the early season squad. As a member of last
season’s team, Chick was exempt from the first two
weeks of indoor practice, but Homer spoke movingly
of needing coaching assistance and Chick,
perhaps because he didn’t expect to be alive in
February, grudgingly consented. Homer was also
Editor-in-Chief of the Doubleay, and the real motive
for his visit became apparent when, the baseball
business being concluded, he introduced the
subject of football. Did Chick consider that Mr.
Cade had made a success of his work this season?
Bert expected animation from Chick at last, but he
was disappointed. Even the opportunity to discuss
Johnny failed to arouse him from the depths
of his despair. He said he guessed Johnny was
doing as well as any one could.</p>

<p>“There’s a good deal of talk about the changes
he made for yesterday’s game, Chick,” said
Homer. “A lot of the fellows think he has sort
of lost his grip this fall. It does look as if he was
a bit panicky, doesn’t it? I mean changing the
team this way in the middle of the season.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Chick gloomily. “Better ask
him, hadn’t you?”</p>

<p>Homer laughed lightly. “That’s not a bad idea.
But I was curious to know how the players themselves
felt about it, you see. We try, in the Doubleay,
to reflect School opinion, Chick, and of
course you fellows on the team have a far better
notion of how things are going than the rest of us.
We don’t mean to quote any one’s opinions personally,
you understand. What we’re after is to
find out how the players themselves size up the
present situation, what their reaction is to this
sudden and apparently high-handed displacing of
so many veteran members of the Team. There’s
no question but what the coach is doing what he
considers best, Chick, but <em>is</em> it best? Doesn’t a
thing like this play hob with the Team’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de
corps</i>? Isn’t it disorganizing? You see what I
mean?”</p>

<p>Chick viewed him balefully. “Sure, I see what
you mean. You want me to grouch and throw
Johnny down. Nothing doing, Homer. You go see
Johnny himself and ask him if he’s cuckoo. I
don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re not very helpful,” laughed
Homer. “What do you say, Hollins?”</p>

<p>“I say it’s poor policy for the Flubdub to criticize
the coach in the middle of the season,” answered
Bert. “Mr. Cade’s done mighty well since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
he’s been here, hasn’t he? What’s the idea in
jumping to the conclusion that he’s going to make
a mess of it this year?”</p>

<p>“No one suggests that he’s making a mess of it,”
Homer protested. “And as for criticism, why, if
it’s helpful Coach Cade is the last one to resent it.
A football coach is only human, Hollins, and he’s
liable to make mistakes of judgment. In that case
he ought to be glad to find it out in time to make—er—correction.
Gosh, the Doubleay isn’t trying
to ride John Cade, Hollins. All we’re trying to do
is deal truthfully with affairs of the School and—and
present, when we can, wise counsel. Now—”</p>

<p>“Applesauce,” moaned Chick.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right!” Homer arose and prepared
for departure. “I don’t see why you’re so blamed
grouchy, Chick. If you had to get out this confounded
paper each week you’d be a bit more—more
sympathetic. But if you don’t want to talk,
don’t.”</p>

<p>“Don’t,” muttered Chick.</p>

<p>Homer retreated in good form, and after the
door had closed Chick said: “Got a lot, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you didn’t bite,” answered Bert.
“After all, whether Johnny is right or wrong, trying
to make a sensation of it in the Flubdub isn’t
going to help. And naturally a chap who was
dropped from the line-up Saturday isn’t going to
talk about it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Huh! I could have given him an earful if I’d
wanted to,” muttered Chick. “I’ve got an opinion,
all right!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you didn’t spill it to Johnson.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, he gives me a pain,” said Chick sadly.</p>

<small>AROUND THE END</small></h2>
</div>


<p>November arrived that week with several days of
unseasonably warm weather, and football practice,
which had started off on Monday with much zest,
slowed up. More than one of the deposed players
lost his ambition to regain his place as the mercury
mounted under the influence of a sun that shone
with the ardor of August; or, if his ambition remained,
his efforts waned perceptibly. Jake decreed
a let-up in the drive and Coach Cade was
forced to obey. That was a worrisome week for
the coach. There were several injuries, the players
showed a disposition to lag, the recent changes
in the make-up of the team were not yielding the
hoped-for results, criticism was rampant and a
graduate who had agreed to appear that Wednesday
and coach the linemen wrote that he wouldn’t
be able to arrive before the week following. While
all the injuries were minor affairs save one, they
nevertheless kept the fellows out of practice for
periods varying from one day to four, and at a
time when the services of every member of the
squad were greatly needed. With the Mt. Millard
game looming up on Saturday, Coach Cade found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
himself far from prepared. The Team was showing
a fairly good brand of defensive playing, but
anything like a consistent attack was still lacking.
The punters, at least two of whom had promised
extremely well at the beginning of the season, had
not made the expected progress, and in that feature
Alton was deficient. Mt. Millard invariably
gave the Gray-and-Gold a stern battle, and, because
she had won almost as often as she had lost,
had come to be regarded as a foe only second in
importance to Kenly Hall. Alton always made
earnest preparation for Mt. Millard and tried
mightily to put over a victory. This fall the game
was to be played on the adversary’s own grounds,
at Warren, a circumstance not favoring Alton.</p>

<p>There was a good stiff work-out on Tuesday,
with the First battering the Scrub in an endeavor
to build up an attack and not succeeding especially
well. Mr. Cade used two sets of backs and saw
them both subdued by the Second. On Wednesday
and Thursday hard work was made impossible by
the heat and the coach counted the days as practically
lost. Friday was more moderate and, despite
Jake’s disapproval, he put the squad through a
full session. The Scrub got trounced roundly that
afternoon, the First putting over three touchdowns
and kicking goals after two of them. The First
played without the services of Patten, at center,
and Ball, at quarter. Patten was nursing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
wrenched knee sustained on Wednesday, and Ted
was favoring an ankle which was causing Jake
much perplexity and some worry. First scored
twice on plunges at the line varied by sweeps and
once on a short pass, Couch to Kruger. The Second
never got nearer the opponent’s goal than the
twenty-four yards, from where, after two forward-passes
had failed, she attempted a drop-kick only
to have it blocked. Both teams were pretty well
played-out by the end and Jake shook his head
dismally over them.</p>

<p>Bert saw his share of work that week, alternating
with Keys in the second set of backs. He did
well on several occasions, not so well on others.
Once through the line or around an end, Bert could
be counted on to make good gains, but lack of
weight handicapped him frequently when the play
called for beef and brawn. On such occasions
Larry Keys was the better of the two. On defense,
however, Bert was showing himself more than
Larry’s equal, for he seemed to have an uncanny
ability to tell where the play was coming through
and a speed not possessed by his rival. He was
confident that he had improved in his playing a
good deal in the course of the season, but he was
equally aware of his shortcomings as a line plunger
and inclined to believe, with Chick, that he would
have to wait until next year to really make good.</p>

<p>Chick was maintaining his attitude of wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
dignity, an attitude which didn’t sit well on him
and which his team-mates resented and ridiculed.
Many of them got sorely out of patience with
Chick about this time and perhaps wondered how
they had ever come to consider him for the captaincy.
The things which had made for popularity
were conspicuously absent, and he had become
what Ted Ball called “snorty.” Nevertheless
Chick managed to play some good football that
week and possibly caused Mr. Cade to wonder
whether he had made a mistake in shifting
him out of the first line-up. Off the field he
seemed to Bert about the same old Chick, save that
he was a trifle moody and had periods of testiness
during which he was hard to get along with. He
pretended that he didn’t care much whether he or
Savell ended the season in possession of his old
position and managed to convey the idea that he
considered it below his dignity to compete for it.
Just the same he did compete, and Fitz was seldom
more than a leap ahead in the race during that
week. He still played pool three and sometimes
four evenings out of seven, but he generally managed
to get to bed if not promptly by ten, at
worst a few minutes after. Bert gathered that
luck still favored Mr. Devore, although Chick had
become close-mouthed on the subject of his favorite
pastime.</p>

<p>All Alton journeyed to Warren on Saturday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
The town was a small, sleepy place, with elm-shaded
streets and old white houses at wide intervals,
and when the Gray-and-Gold cohorts descended
upon it, as they did every other fall, it
seemed to fairly shiver with outrage. Mt. Millard
School lay on the outskirts of the village, at the
end of a wide and shadowed street from which this
afternoon clouds of dust arose under the tread of
the invaders. There was no lofty eminence in
sight to account for the school’s name, but the
buildings did occupy a perceptible rise in the landscape,
beyond which, on a level plateau of still
verdant sod, stretched the playing field. As the
day, while not nearly so hot as the middle of the
week, was decidedly warm, the visitors were grateful
for the shade supplied by a row of giant elms
that traversed one edge of the field. Scorning the
half of a small grandstand reserved for them, they
made themselves comfortable on the grass, while
those of affluence and foresight produced provender
purchased on the way and did their best toward
supplying the school caretakers with a real
day’s work for Monday.</p>

<p>Alton took the field at three with the same line-up
used last week with the exception of Lovell for
Ball at quarter-back. Ted’s ankle was still “backward
in coming forward” and, although Jake had
consented to his playing if necessity required, he
had resigned himself to an afternoon of idleness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Mt. Millard had requested shortened periods in
deference to the warmth and thirteen- and twelve-minute
quarters had been decided on. Alton won
the toss and chose to receive the kick-off and the
contest started.</p>

<p>Nip Storer caught near his fifteen yards and
found the enemy presenting a tough resistance to
his advance and was satisfied with reaching the
twenty-two. A wide sweep, with Jim Galvin carrying
the ball from kicking position netted all but one
yard of the required ten, and after Nip had failed
to get the distance on a plunge at guard he punted
to Mt. Millard’s thirty-three. Dutch Kruger was
on hand when the local quarter-back got the ball
and stopped the latter for a two-yard gain. Mt.
Millard tried out Thomas and made two and swung
around Savell’s end for three more. A heave over
the center grounded and the ball sailed back to
Alton’s twenty where Lovell caught, fumbled and
recovered on the twenty-seven. The Gray-and-Gold
used the sweep play and crossed the middle
of the field in six downs. There, however, Lovell
again fumbled and Mt. Millard got the pigskin.
A thrust at Meecham yielded a couple of yards and
the quarter skimmed Savell for three more. On
third down a double pass, with the ball finally
going off toward the side line to a waiting end,
almost succeeded, but Kruger leaped into the air
at the last possible instant and knocked the oval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
down. Mt. Millard faked a punt and made it first
down with a six yard run by full-back. Two
slams at the left of the line netted five yards and
a criss-cross sent a back grinding off Haines for
three more. Again a punt was faked and Mt.
Millard threw straight over center and well down
the field for a sixteen-yard advance that put the
ball on Alton’s twenty-four. There Alton braced
and on two plunges the opponent lost three yards.
A fake forward-pass became a wide sprint by left
half, but he was tumbled by Thomas and it was
fourth down with nine to go and the pigskin close
to a side-line. It was then that the home team
won the visitor’s vast respect.</p>

<p>The angle was too sharp to allow of a field-goal
attempt with any hope of success. Nine yards had
to be gained if possession of the ball was to be retained.
Alton’s line had so far proved too strong
for assaults between tackles. Consequently there
remained, apparently at least, three courses for
Mt. Millard. She could try a forward-pass, an off-tackle
play or an end run. To Alton the forward-pass
seemed the likeliest, since Mt. Millard had
shown herself able to gain in that manner. Consequently
when the home team sent her kicker
back to position well over the thirty-yard line the
adversary was sure that a heave across the line
would follow, and her backs formed to cover. That
the Mt. Millard quarter patted the ground smooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and knelt to receive the pass from center failed to
alter the enemy’s mind. All that elaborate preparatory
stuff was as old as the hills! The ball
would shoot straight to the full-back, who had been
on the forwarding end of two of Mt. Millard’s
heaves, and he would throw. But Alton was due to
see a play new in her experience.</p>

<p>While it is an extremely difficult feat to kick the
ball over the bar and between the uprights from a
position on the thirty-yard line close to the boundary,
it is not particularly difficult to accomplish
the same thing from a position in front of the goal.
And, of course, the difficulty decreases as the
center of the line is approached. Doubtless this
thought occurred to the Mt. Millard quarter, for
when the ball left the hands of the center it didn’t
go to the kneeling quarter but to the left half,
standing some four yards back of the left guard-tackle
hole. At the signal the full-back started
across the field, followed, when the ball went into
play, by the right half and quarter. Left half
turned with the ball and, just as the defense
yielded behind him, threw it across to the full-back.
The pass was lateral and a good fifteen
yards in length. Full-back made a clean catch of
it, continued for another three or four strides and
stopped abruptly. Right half-back and quarter
met the first of the enemy, and at that moment the
full-back’s leg swung, the ball rebounded from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
sod, was met by a capable foot and went upwards
and away just as Alton reënforcements came up.
The drop-kick was made from a point some eight
yards short of the middle of the field and close
to the twenty-eight yards, and the ball sailed
squarely over the center of the bar!</p>

<p>Of course it was an absolutely impossible sort
of play. It just couldn’t be done! Alton blankly
assured herself of that. But the assurance
brought no consolation since, you see, it had been
done! Mt. Millard’s supporters went quite crazy
with delight and the full-back was pummeled by
his enthusiastic team-mates. Alton recovering
from her surprise, congregated about the officials
and protested the play. Captain Jonas declared,
doubtfully though, that a drop-kick following a side
pass was illegal, but, when instructed to point to
the rule covering the point, he could only shake his
head.</p>

<p>Mt. Millard’s name on the small score-board
above the stand was graced by an excited youth
with a large figure 3 and the game proceeded.
That lone tally was unchanged when the half
ended.</p>

<p>There had by that time been three changes in
Alton’s line-up, all in the second quarter. Cahill
had gone in at center for Lum Patten, whose game
knee had received a further indignity, Ness had
superseded Storer and Keys had taken Walsh’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
place at right half. Walsh had shown up rather
poorly on defense. Nip had been retired that he
might be returned later in fresh condition. In the
draped-off corner of the gymnasium floor during
the fifteen minutes between the halves Coach Cade
talked very quietly and convincingly. They had,
he told them, shown themselves able to stop Mt.
Millard’s line attack. Consequently, the adversary
would undoubtedly rely more strongly than before
on her aerial game. And she would get away with
it unless Alton watched more closely and covered
the opposing eligibles. “You must stop trying to
guess the play, fellows. You can’t do it against
a team like the one you’re up against to-day. The
only way to find what the play is going to be is to
use your eyes and your brains and, above all,
watch the ball! Don’t think that the enemy is
going to do a certain thing just because it’s what
you’d do in her case. She’s got a clever quarter
in there and he has caught you napping twice already.
Watch the ball every minute and follow it
close. That’s the only way you’ll stop Mt. Millard.”</p>

<p>The third quarter was Mt. Millard’s, although
there was no scoring. A forlorn attempt from
Alton’s thirty-seven yards to put the ball over
from a placement kick failed badly some five minutes
after the start. Still later, after Alton had
made a fine but futile drive down the field from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
own thirty-eight to Mt. Millard’s thirty-six, the
home team took possession of the ball and by plays
off the tackles, two forward passes that netted but
twelve yards and a twenty-odd-yard dash by the
left half worked the pigskin back to the visitor’s
twenty-eight. There it was when the third quarter
ended.</p>

<p>Nip Storer had already returned to his position
at left half and Patten was back at center. Nat
Wick, hurt in a savage attack at his position, had
yielded to Hop Meecham. Now another change
was made, for Ted Ball hobbled on and relieved
Bus Lovell. Not that Bus appeared to view it as
a relief, however! With two downs remaining,
Mt. Millard tried her familiar trick of faking a
kick and threw forward. Dutch Kruger, though,
had his man covered well and the ball grounded.
The Mt. Millard full-back strode off to the thirty-seven
yards and held out his arms. But before his
foot reached the ball Billy Haines was on top
of him and the kick only sent the pigskin bounding
back from Billy’s body. Followed a wild and
frantic pursuit that was finally ended when Fitz
Savell fell on the ball close to the forty-five-yard
line.</p>

<p>Alton now brought her heavy artillery into play,
hurling Jim Galvin and Storer at the wings on
short plunges that twice won first downs and took
the ball to Mt. Millard’s thirty-three. There, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the enemy closed up, and after a sweep to the
right, with Keys carrying, had failed of more than
a yard Galvin tossed across the center to Savell
who was downed where he caught for a six-yard
gain. Jim smashed out two more at center with
Number 14. (The delayed pass play had been
used but twice before that afternoon and had failed
each time, seeming to prove Chick’s contention
that it wouldn’t fool a wide-awake opponent.)
But this time it succeeded, if not greatly, and left
the pigskin less than a yard short of the distance.
Ted Ball asked for time and conferred with Captain
Jonas. Ted favored a field-goal and a tied
score, for, with Storer drop-kicking from the
thirty-three yards and almost in front of goal,
the chance was excellent. But Captain Lowe held
other views. The game was close to its end and in
his judgment a tied score was tantamount to defeat,
and Jonas wanted a victory. While they were
still talking, two substitutes ran on. These were
Tyron and Hollins, relieving Nip Storer and Larry
Keys. Nip raged and Ted Ball protested, but
rage and protest carried no weight with the official.
Nip went off, plainly incensed, followed more
mildly by Keys, and Ted knew that Captain Jonas
had won the argument. With Storer out of the
backfield there was no one remaining who could
be relied on for a field-goal. Of course Coach Cade
had sided with Jonas and this was his way of announcing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the fact. Johnny, too, chose to gain all
or lose all, and Ted studied the situation. Tyron
was a heavy back who had remained a third
choice all season. Hollins was a light, fast player
who must be provided with safe conduct through
the enemy lines before he could prove his value.
But Hollins too had more than once completed a
forward-pass for a good gain. Ted’s brows
wrinkled while he used up every second of the two
minutes he had demanded. When the whistle
blew he had made his decision.</p>

<p>Of course he must set the stage for a field-goal
first, and that he did. But when he called his signals
Tyron shouted “Over! Over!” That, Ted
reflected bitterly, was like the dumb-bell! Tyron
could carry a ball and batter a line, but his was
no agile brain! Ted called the play again, changing
the first signals, and waited until a show of
relief on Tyron’s countenance indicated that the
idea had percolated to the seat of reason. Then
he repeated and the ball went back.</p>

<p>But not to Galvin, back in kicker’s place. It
went to Ted, and Ted swung around with it and,
after a tick of time, tossed it toward a speeding
form. The whole Alton backfield was moving to
the left now, and not only the backfield but Captain
Jonas and Hop Meecham and, last of all, Fitz
Savell, following around as rear guard. Tyron
headed the interference, Bert carried, Galvin ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
beside the latter. It was Jim who met the enemy
right end and heaved him aside. Bert found himself
slowed by Tyron and swung outside as the
defensive end went down. Then he wheeled
sharply and cut in. A back lunged toward him
out of the mêlée, but Savell charged between, and
Bert, his head up and eyes busy, saw the open road
ahead.</p>

</div>


<p>When he thought about it afterwards, and he did
think about it a good deal during the next day or
two, it seemed to Bert that it had been absurdly
simple, that dash from the enemy’s twenty-four
to the goal line and over. To be sure, just at the
last the Mt. Millard quarter had forced him well
toward the boundary, but he had never been seriously
challenged after he had cut through and he
had crossed the last streak of lime with his head
up and a watchful eye on the approaching safety
man; crossed it, indeed, with an unconscious unconcern
that had added to the joy of the already
ecstatic Alton watchers. It had been very easy,
and, while he was human enough to like the applause
he had won, and the enthusiastic pummelings
of his team-mates, and all the nice things that
had been said to him since, he was convinced that
any of his fellow players would have turned the
trick just as neatly as he had and that, when all was
considered, he had mighty little title to the rôle of
hero. Of course he had done his best, had used
his head and his speed, but there was no getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
around the fact that it was perfect interference
that had won that touchdown and the Mt. Millard
game. If Jim Galvin had missed the end, if Fitz
Savell hadn’t taken out that back, if, in short, the
whole team of eleven players hadn’t each performed
his part perfectly, the play would have fizzled.
Where then, reflected Bert, was the glory?
Surely the credit should be equally apportioned
amongst the team and not given all to him. He
was dimly regretful that this was so and wished
that he might have somehow really earned the
honor that had been accorded him; wished that he
might have got away without the help of an army
of interferers and made the run on his own. He
could have been proud of that. As it was he felt
apologetic toward the other fellows of the team
and wondered if they were not secretly amused,
perhaps nettled, at the praise he was receiving.
They didn’t appear to be, though. In fact, they
had behaved quite as if that touchdown had been
a one-man job, a personal triumph for Bert. He
couldn’t understand that at first.</p>

<p>He would have liked to talk the affair over at
length with Chick that Saturday evening, but
Chick, while he was about, was not an inviting recipient
of confidences. Chick was steaming mad.
He had remained on the bench all during the game.
Even after Bert had pulled the contest out of the
fire with that dash for a touchdown and Coach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Cade had strengthened the team here and there
with fresh material in order to hold the enemy
during the succeeding three minutes, Chick had
not been called on. Shelfer had relieved Savell,
and Chick had looked on incredulously. Afterwards
he had been bitter toward the coach, declaring
that Johnny was trying to humiliate him,
threatening to go over to the other’s lodgings and
have it out with him, on the verge of quitting the
team. Bert had tried to pour oil on the troubled
waters and the oil had ignited. Chick had sneered
that of course Bert couldn’t see anything wrong
because Johnny was treating him decently; even
better than he deserved, Chick seemed to intimate.
Bert had frozen up at that and a little later Chick,
still hectic with anger, had taken himself away.
Bert had hoped that he wasn’t off to Coach Cade’s
to carry out his threatened intention of informing
Johnny what he thought of him, and had been
half inclined to follow and prevent such a break,
but reflection reassured him. Chick was angrier
than Bert had known him to be for a long time, and
when he was angry he was capable of extremes,
but it wasn’t likely that he would do anything as
suicidal as that. He hadn’t seen Chick again that
evening, but on Sunday Chick let out that he had
played pool with Lester Devore, and borrowed
all of Bert’s available funds, amounting to four
dollars and a half, to pay for his fun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“For the love of Pete!” exclaimed Bert. “How
much did you lose?”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is some I’ve been owing him,” replied
Chick evasively. “He always wins, the lucky stiff!
I’ll pay you back next week.”</p>

<p>“I’m not worrying about getting it back,” said
Bert, frowning. “But—but, great Scott, Chick,
that’s a pile of money to lose!”</p>

<p>“Don’t I know it?” demanded the other peevishly.
“That’s what I’m sore about. He gets all
the breaks, hang him, and I haven’t had a stroke
of luck at that game for two weeks!”</p>

<p>“Why not quit?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“And let him get away with nearly—with a
whole bunch of my coin?” inquired Chick amazedly.
“That’s a swell idea! I’m going to keep
after that bird till I pluck him, and pluck him good
and close!”</p>

<p>“It’s my hunch that he’s a tough bird,” said
Bert wryly.</p>

<p>“Tough? He’s just a fool for luck, that’s all
he is. By the way, he’s coming up this afternoon
after this money. If you’re here and I’m not slip
it to him, will you? I’ll leave it here on the corner
of the table.”</p>

<p>“How much?” asked Bert from the window-seat.</p>

<p>“Eight,” answered Chick. “Tell him that’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
all— No, never mind. Don’t tell him anything.
I’ll probably be in, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Try to, will you?” said Bert. “You know,
Charles, I don’t warm to that Mr. Devore much.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s all right except for being a lot luckier
than the law allows.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but I don’t crave to entertain him. I’ll
be over in Lykes around five o’clock, so—”</p>

<p>“What are you going over there for?” interrupted
Chick.</p>

<p>“I told Ted Ball I’d be over. He seemed to
think my presence would add to his happiness.
Better come along.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to play some golf with Dozier at
three. I suppose Ted’s going to tell you how good
you are, eh?”</p>

<p>“If he does I promise not to believe him,” answered
Bert good-humoredly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you will! You’ll get a swelled head
like all the rest of the heroes; like Ted himself for
that matter. What’s become of the sports section?”</p>

<p>“Here you are.” Bert pulled a portion of the
Sunday paper from beneath him and tossed it
across. “That was some game at Lakeville yesterday.
Have you read it? Kenly fairly mowed
’em down, eh?”</p>

<p>“Just as she’ll mow us down a couple of weeks
from now,” growled Chick. “If you want to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
a killing, Bert, put up some money on her. I know
where you’ll be able to place it when the time
comes.”</p>

<p>“Bet against my own team?” asked Bert. “I’d
be likely to, wouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you wouldn’t risk a dollar either
way,” said Chick pityingly. “When it comes to
betting, old scout, one team looks just like another
to me. I’d as soon pull down a ten dollar bill on
Kenly as on Alton.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it. Anyhow, you’re not thinking
of doing it, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Chick impatiently.
“You bet to win, don’t you? Think I’d back Alton
if she was certain to get licked?” Then, as he
caught the troubled expression on the other’s face,
he added: “Oh, well, I’m not likely to have much
money to bet on football games, I guess, the way
the luck’s running.”</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t have a blamed cent,” replied
Bert shortly, “if you’d use it that way!”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you’ll get your wish,” Chick
grunted.</p>

<p>As it turned out, it was, after all, Bert who received
Lester Devore when that gentleman came
to Number 21 about half-past four. Chick had
predicted his return before that hour, but he was
still absent. Mr. Devore was attired most becomingly
for Sunday afternoon in a suit of gray plaid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
a purplish-gray felt hat, a violet shirt and a burnt-orange—or
possibly henna—scarf pierced by a
pearl stickpin. Mr. Devore was what you might
call a tasty dresser. Still, Bert wondered if he
hadn’t perhaps done the chap an injustice, for he
had a likable look and his manners were not at all
bad as he accepted Bert’s invitation to sit down
and await Chick’s return. Perhaps it would have
been better had he pulled his sharply-creased
trousers up at the knees less impressively, but that
was a very little thing after all. Bert offered the
weather as a subject of discourse and Devore’s
conversation was worthy of polite society. He
didn’t swear once. He admired the room and expressed
curiosity about some of its features, a
curiosity which Bert courteously gratified. Then
Devore said, smiling: “Guess you feel pretty good
to-day, eh, Hollins? You won that game, and no
error!”</p>

<p>“Oh, did you see it?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“No, I couldn’t get away, but I was talking with
a fellow who was over to it. He said you made a
sweet run. Right through the other team, he said,
and never hurried!”</p>

<p>“He was slightly mistaken, though,” said Bert
dryly, “for I certainly did hurry.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I guess you had to! But this guy—this
fellow said you fooled ’em all pretty clever. Good
game, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“We think so,” answered the host, aware that
his dislike of Devore was returning. “We naturally
would.”</p>

<p>“Sure.” Devore chuckled. “Make anything?”</p>

<p>“Make anything?” Bert looked puzzled.
“Only that touchdown.”</p>

<p>Devore laughed. “I meant did you have any
money up. But I guess those Mt. Millard kids
aren’t very sporty. Say, what do you think of our
chances in the scrap with Kenly, eh?”</p>

<p>“Our chances?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, Alton’s. Who’s going to win that, would
you say?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t say,” replied Bert. “Kenly’s got
a pretty good team, I guess, and seems to be getting
better every day. What we’ve got no one
seems to know yet.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. It’s no cinch either way, I figure.
Only thing is, Hollins, Kenly has the science, if
you get me. Look at last year. Lots of guys
said you fellows had ought to had that game. But
it seemed like the other guys had the sign on you.
That’s science, ain’t it? Sure. Well, I figure it
might be like that again. Over at Lakeville they
think pretty good of that team. I know because
I’ve got friends over there and I hear ’em talk.
Still, that ain’t saying we mightn’t spring a surprise
on ’em, is it? Some play they don’t know
about, or something, eh? I wouldn’t want to bet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
you fellows haven’t got something sweet up your
sleeve, Hollins.”</p>

<p>Devore smiled engagingly, inviting confidence.
Bert shrugged. “Maybe. A team usually saves
something for the final game.”</p>

<p>“Of course. And if it’s good it turns the trick,
don’t it? I heard you fellows were working up
a pretty sweet forward-passing game and sort of
keeping it under cover, but maybe that isn’t a
fact.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it is a fact. So far our forward-passing
isn’t anything to boast of, Devore.”</p>

<p>“That so? I haven’t been able to see you fellows
in action yet, so I don’t know much about
your game. What do you think Cade means to
spring on those Kenly bozos?”</p>

<p>“Really, I can’t say. Probably he will just trust
to good, hard football.”</p>

<p>“He might do worse,” said Devore thoughtfully,
his gaze returning again to the folded bills on the
corner of the table. The money left by Chick appeared
to interest him a great deal. Bert wished
that Chick would return. So, perhaps, did Devore,
for after a moment he said: “Looks like he wasn’t
coming back, eh? Maybe I’d better beat it. He
didn’t say anything about some money he owed
me, did he?”</p>

<p>Bert nodded. “Right at your elbow.”</p>

<p>Devore took it with elaborate hesitancy, but his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
eyes lighted as he did so. He counted the notes
and then turned a swift, frowning look on Bert.
“What’s the idea?” he asked sharply. “There’s
only eight here!”</p>

<p>“So he told me,” said Bert. “Possibly that’s
all he had handy. Should there be more?”</p>

<p>Devore laughed wryly. “I’ll say there should!
Why, that guy owes me eighteen-seventy-five, and
he’s been pushing me back for a week. Say, what’s
the idea, eh? Ain’t he got plenty of it, or what?
He talked like he was filthy with the stuff; about
his father being a banker and how he had his
own private billiard table at home and all that.
Stringing me, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so,” answered Bert coldly.
“Chick’s father is a banker, all right enough, but
if you know anything about bankers, Devore, you
know that they have a pretty good idea of the value
of money. Which is probably why Chick has an
allowance of five dollars a week and no more.”</p>

<p>Mr. Devore whistled expressively. “Five dollars
a week!” he marveled. “Say, the Old Man’s
a regular spendthrift, ain’t he?” There was a cold
sparkle in his eye that informed Bert that his statement
had not been accepted at face value. But
Devore smiled as he arose and added casually:
“Well, no use pushing a guy when he ain’t got it,
is there? Tell him I’ll see him to-morrow night,
will you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look here, Devore,” said Bert, “I wish you’d
discourage Chick about this pool playing. At least
until after the football season’s through. He isn’t
getting any good out of it. He’s supposed to be in
bed at ten o’clock and he almost never is. And it’s
taking his thoughts off his game. You seem to be
interested in having us win the Kenly game, and
I presume you call yourself Chick’s friend. Well,
if so call off the pool for a couple of weeks, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>“I’m willing, sure, Hollins, but if he shows up
down at Mooney’s and wants a game, what about
it? I might as well play him as any one else, eh?
Best thing’s for you to keep him at home, I guess.”</p>

<p>“It would be,” answered Bert, “but it’s not
so easy.”</p>

<p>“Sort of wants his own way, don’t he? I noticed
that myself. Well, anyhow, I’ll do what I can. I
guess you’re right about it’s interfering with football,
for I heard he wasn’t going so good lately;
and last night he was sure sore as a pup on that
Cade guy. Well, see you later!”</p>

<p>Mr. Devore departed, jaunty and cheerful, eight
dollars richer than on his arrival, and Bert, discovering
that there was no time at present to
worry about Chick’s finances, hurried away to
Lykes.</p>

<p>In Number 5, Ted Ball was in sole possession
when Bert entered. Ted arose from under a rustling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
burden of newspapers and kicked a chair
toward the radiator. “Sit low and roost your
feet,” he invited. “Sort of coolish, isn’t it? Well,
how’s the hero feeling to-day?”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” said Bert, grinning. “I’m no hero,
and you know it. Listen here, Ted. I want to
know something. What’s the idea of pretending
that I pulled a big stunt yesterday when you know
well enough, and every one else knows, too, that it
was the rest of you chaps who did the hard work?”</p>

<p>Ted looked mildly surprised. “Hard work?
How do you acquire that condition, Bert? The
rest of us did our parts, of course, but you carried
the old prolate spheroid, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but what of it? I couldn’t help getting
through that line with about six of you going ahead
and behind. You see, Ted, I have a funny feeling
that all you others are sort of laughing in your
sleeve when fellows give me the credit.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s it; I get you now, Bert.” Ted observed
the caller speculatively for a moment and
then shook his head. “You’re too modest, old
chap. If you don’t watch your step you’ll never
make a football player; a real ne plus ultra one, I
mean. You’ve got to get rid of your modesty
first.”</p>

<p>“Quit talking rot,” grumbled Bert.</p>

<p>“All right. Let me tell you something that,
maybe, hasn’t occurred to you. When you read in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the paper that some fellow has raced forty or sixty
or eighty or something yards and scored a touchdown
and has thereby become a hero and a—a
popular idol, you—if you’re like most folks—don’t
stop to ask how come that fellow was able to do
it. Sometimes, but not often, he did it because he
was a remarkable runner and dodger and because
Lady Luck paced him most of the way, but most
times—about nine times out of ten—he did it because
ten other fellows got him started and, say,
four other fellows helped him past the secondary
defense and, maybe, two others went with him most
of the way and upset tacklers and saw him through.
All that, old chap, is what generally happens.
Can’t be any other way—often, for it stands to
reason that one man, no matter how gosh-awful
good he is, can’t attack eleven opponents and get
away with it.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s so,” said Bert thoughtfully.
“And that’s what I meant, too. Take yesterday—”</p>

<p>“All right, take yesterday. You made that
touchdown because Jake looked after you all
season and Johnny Cade taught you how to play
and I gave you the signals and the whole team did
its part and four or five of us helped you along.
So, you see, if you count in Jimmy, the rubber, and
a couple of the managers, all of whom did their bit,
Bert, quite a few of us had a hand in your stunt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
But the point is that you were the big cheese. If
you hadn’t been good, mighty good, all our stuff
wouldn’t have amounted to anything at all. Sort
of like firing a rifle, old chap. I aimed and pulled
the trigger. Jim and Tyron and Wick and the
others were the cap and the powder. Without us
there wouldn’t have been any explosion and you’d
still be in the cartridge. But the cap and the powder
did their parts and the bullet shot out. You
were the bullet, Bert, and the bullet’s what does
the execution and brings down the game!”</p>

<p>“Carrying out your simile,” laughed Bert, “it’s
the fellow who aims and shoots who gets the credit,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Similes,” replied Ted, “are like practical
jokes. They can be carried too far. It’s this way
about individual stunts on the football field.
Every fellow deserves a certain amount of credit
for what the one member of the team perfects, just
how much depending on how close to the play he
was. That’s understood. But they don’t all take
off their head guards and bow when the stand
cheers the hero.”</p>

<p>“But why don’t they? They have a right to.”</p>

<p>“Because—well, I suppose it’s because they
recognize the fact that, no matter how much they
helped, individually and collectively, it was Mr.
Hero who brought home the bacon. No fellow,
Bert, can pull off a big stunt in a football game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
unaided, but, oh, boy, he can sure do himself proud
if he makes good use of what help he gets and
knows what to do when the interference peters
out! Some backs don’t know how to use their interference,
Bert. You’ll see everything set for a
big act, and then the runner takes it into his head
to break away from interference, or he gets ahead
of it or drops too far behind it, and, bingo,
some one slips in and nabs him! And there are
lots of good backs who can deliver the goods just
as long as they can keep their heads down and butt
and push and fight. Let them get free, though,
with a safety man ahead and a few fellows coming
along behind and they don’t know where they’re
at. And only one back in ten ever turns out to be
a good broken-field runner, Bert. When he does
he’s usually a wonder. Either a fellow is poor at
it or he’s mighty good. So, after you give every
fellow on the team his rightful share of credit, the
fellow who pulls off the fine long run deserves all
the cheering he gets. And that’s why you can rest
easy about the other chaps laughing in their
sleeves at you, Bert. They just aren’t doing it!”</p>

<p>“Well,” muttered Bert doubtfully. “Anyhow
what I did yesterday wasn’t worth all the fuss that
was made. Why, hang it, a baby could have made
that goal line! There wasn’t a soul in the way!”</p>

<p>“Well, why wasn’t there? If you hadn’t slipped
around Tyron and then cut over the end you’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
have been stopped for sure. I saw you do that,
old chap, and do it yourself with no help from any
one else. And how about that Mt. Millard quarter?
You had to get by him, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Sure, but he didn’t bother me any.”</p>

<p>“Of course he didn’t,” laughed Ted, “because
instead of heading for the goal you swung to the
right first and made him think you were making
for the other side and then swung back to the left
and beat him to the corner.”</p>

<p>“Did I?” asked Bert. “I don’t remember doing
that!”</p>

<p>“Maybe so, but that’s what you did. You held
that safety man just long enough on the wrong
slant to queer his act. Of course it was the fact
that you were faster than he was that won for
you, but you fooled him besides. I tried to work
over to get him but I couldn’t make it. Anyway,
you didn’t need me.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had more weight, Ted,” said Bert
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. Yes, you could stand another
ten or twelve pounds, Bert, but I don’t see
that you need it yet. You see, what helps you is
your speed and your blamed elusiveness, and if
you had more weight you mightn’t carry it so well.
And that reminds me that I asked you over here
at Johnny’s suggestion. I fancy he means to use
you more from now on. He seemed to think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
it would be a good idea for you and I to get together
and sort of talk over some of the plays that
we’ll use against Kenly. Sometimes a chap gets
a better grip on a play if he kind of pulls it apart
and puts it together again and understands just
what it’s all about; when it’s to be used and what’s
to be expected of it and that sort of thing. Got
half an hour before supper?”</p>

<p>Bus Lovell provided what in stage parlance is
termed the “comic relief” that week. Bus had
made three fumbles in Saturday’s game, and, although
he had recovered two of them, Coach Cade
decided that Bus needed discipline. So, when a
light practice was over on Monday, Johnny requisitioned
a scarred and battered ball from Jake
and gravely handed it to Bus. “Lovell,” he said,
“if you recall the talk we had in the gymnasium
one afternoon awhile back you’ll understand why
I’m giving you this. Fumbling, Lovell, is a bad
habit for a quarter-back. Keep this with you as
a reminder of that fact.”</p>

<p>Bus tried to grin, got rather red and finally
stammered: “You mean I’ve got to keep it around,
sir? Carry it with me like you said?”</p>

<p>A dozen interested spectators wore very broad
smiles and there were chuckles when Mr. Cade replied:
“Exactly, Lovell. You’re not to part with
it for a moment except when you’re asleep. Then
the ball rests beside you. You might put it on a
chair at the head of your bed. You see, Lovell,
the idea is to accustom yourself to the sight and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
feel of it so that you’ll know what to do with it if
you run across it in a game.”</p>

<p>Conscious of the joyous amusement of those who
had lingered for the ceremony, Bus put on a good
face. “Very well, sir,” he answered as seriously
as Mr. Cade had spoken, “I’ll certainly hang on
to it.” He put it under an arm and strode off,
followed by the group of hilarious team-mates.</p>

<p>His appearance in dining hall that evening was
the signal for a deal of razzing. Warned of his
approach, the fellows clapped enthusiastically as
he stepped through the door with the football
swinging in one hand from the lacing. For an
instant Bus was nonplused, but then, composing
his countenance, he placed the ball under an arm
and made his way gravely along the aisle. The
honors might have been his if some wag hadn’t
started patting a foot in time to Bus’s tread. That
set them all going, and poor Bus paced the length
of the hall to the rhythmic <em>tramp-tramp</em> of hundreds
of feet. After that every one gave way to
laughter and the commotion continued until Mr.
Kincaid, in charge, arose and calmed it. Bus’s
troubles hadn’t ended, though, for it at once became
a matter of duty on the part of his companions
to deprive him of his treasure. If Bus laid
the football beside his plate some one reached
around behind him and sent it wobbling among the
viands. If he placed it in his lap it was instantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
bobbing around under the table, being kicked this
way and that, or was out in the aisle endangering
the safety of passing trays. If he held on to it
with both hands he couldn’t eat! Bus began to
suspect that the thing was less of a joke than he
had surmised. At least so far as he was concerned.
During the evening, if he laid the ball down for
an instant it mysteriously disappeared, and he
learned that eternal vigilance was the price of
peace. He finally solved the difficulty by tying a
cord through the lacing and hanging the pesky
thing around his neck.</p>

<p>By morning it had occurred to some one of Bus’s
intimates that the humorous possibilities of the
football had not been nearly exhausted. His appearance
at breakfast had fallen rather flat, and
the fun of knocking the ball off his lap had somewhat
palled. Hence a new way of adding to the
joy of life must be devised. The plan evolved required
Bus’s consent and participation, and, since
Bus was not one to deprive a friend of a little innocent
amusement, he gave the first and promised the
latter. At quarter to eleven, Bus, who was a member
of the Junior Class, repaired to Room C,
wherein had already gathered Mr. Kincaid and
some forty youths. Mr. Kincaid, on the small
platform at the end of the room, snapped his watch
shut and nodded toward the door. One of the
class, awaiting the signal, arose and proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to close it. As though he had waited outside for
that moment—as in reality he had—Bus entered,
the faithful football snuggled in one arm, his book
and pad in hand and an earnest, detached look on
his face. There were empty seats, a very few,
near the door, but Bus for once chose to sit close
to the preceptor and went sedately down the aisle
to the very first row, observed by the class with
breathless interest and by the instructor with interest
which, if not exactly breathless, was quite
as earnest. Bus seated himself, placed the football—still
attached to his person by the cord—in his
lap, folded his hands and raised an expectant gaze
to Mr. Kincaid. Mr. Kincaid leveled a pencil at
the ball and asked mildly: “What have you there,
Lovell?”</p>

<p>“A football, sir,” replied Bus innocently.</p>

<p>“Ah, a football!” The instructor seemed gratified,
as though he had suspected the object of being
a football and was pleased to have the accuracy
of his surmise confirmed. The class maintained
a silence quite unusual, anxious to miss no whit
of the fun. “You appear,” said Mr. Kincaid, “to
be quite attached to it.”</p>

<p>Bus recognized the jest with a polite smile and
fingered the cord as a further indication that he
had “got” it. “Yes, sir,” he replied, “I am.”</p>

<p>“And”—Mr. Kincaid blinked, a method used
to indicate guilelessness which fooled nobody—“and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the football seems to be quite as attached
to you. A truly beautiful friendship, Lovell.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Bus spoke more doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” went on the instructor musingly,
“quite—ah—affecting. Just what was it, Lovell,
that drew you together, besides a similarity of
mental equipment?”</p>

<p>“Sir?” Repressed snickers from about him
confirmed his suspicion that Mr. Kincaid had
scored. The instructor was affably patient.</p>

<p>“I asked what first drew you to each other,
Lovell, but never mind that. Instead, tell me
whether you would be willing to part with your,
shall I say alter ego? during a brief period which
I propose to devote to the subject of Greek history.”</p>

<p>Bus was back on solid ground again. He had
been waiting for that question. He shook his head,
sadly yet emphatically.</p>

<p>“Sorry, sir, but that’s impossible,” said Bus
firmly.</p>

<p>“Impossible!” Mr. Kincaid clicked his tongue.
“Dear, dear! And may I ask—” He paused and
peered intently. “Just hold the football up a
moment, please, Lovell. Ah, thank you. For
the instant I had you confused. Yes, I see. The
football is the one with the look of intelligence.
As I was saying—”</p>

<p>But what he was saying was lost in the laughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
laughter in which Bus joined only half-heartedly.
Mr. Kincaid looked over the class and blinked in
gentle reproof. “As I was saying,” he continued,
“I am curious to know why you find it impossible
to do without your affinity for a mere half-hour
or so, Lovell. I hope I am not too inquisitive.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Cade’s orders, sir,” answered Bus with
relief. “I have to take it everywhere, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah, really? An extension course in Football,
I presume. Remarkable what strides that game is
making, isn’t it? Is there more to your story?”</p>

<p>Bus explained the situation and Mr. Kincaid
listened with undisguised interest. And at the end
he settled back and said: “Well, well, what a very
clever idea of Mr. Cade’s! I shall be anxious to
hear how it succeeds, Lovell. And now, having
exhausted, not unprofitably I’m sure, some seven
minutes of our allotted time, we will turn our attention
to less weighty matters.”</p>

<p>Whether or not it was due to the football and its
accompanying complications, the fact is that Bus
was but illy prepared on the subject of Greek History
and, as Mr. Kincaid was flatteringly attentive
and called on him very frequently, made a poor
showing. Just before the gong rang the instructor
stepped down from the platform. He
held a book in his hand and he stopped in front of
Bus. “Lovell,” he announced, “I regret to say
that out of six questions sent your way you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
fumbled four. To be sure, you may fairly be said
to have recovered one, but nevertheless the loss
of ground was considerable. On one occasion,
if you recall, you lost almost a third of Greece!
Fumbling, Lovell, is a—ah—most reprehensible
failing, and we must do our utmost to correct it.
Taking a leaf from the book of a greater master,
certainly a more successful instructor, than myself,
Lovell, I intrust this volume to you. It is,
as you will observe, my own copy of West’s
Ancient World, Part One. You will find my name
on the fly-leaf. I should dislike having anything
happen to it, so please guard it tenderly. Don’t
let it out of your sight, Lovell. Take it with you to
recitations and reflections, let it accompany you
wherever you go, Lovell, especially to the football
field. At night place it beside you while you
slumber. Constant companionship, continued
proximity, Lovell, will, I sincerely trust, cure you
of your lamentable habit of fumbling the facts of
Greek History. Class dismissed.”</p>

<p>Bus remained behind for a minute after his
convulsed class-mates had hurried forth, but it was
no use. Mr. Kincaid meant just what he had said,
as absolutely ridiculous as it all was! Bus departed
with the football bobbing from his neck and
West’s Ancient World clutched desperately in one
hand. He tried putting it into a pocket, but it was
just too large for that. In the corridor the news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
was already circulating, and Bus was made to
pause and exhibit his latest incubus until, patience
exhausted, he tore himself from detaining hands
and fled. In his room he flung the book distastefully
away from him, only to rescue it in a panic,
fearful that he had harmed it. Then he put it
on the table and glowered at it until, presently,
a sense of humor came to his aid and he gave a
chuckle. Somewhere, he recollected, his room-mate
had a canvas haversack, and he searched until he
unearthed it. In it he placed Mr. West’s masterpiece
and adjusted the straps to his shoulders.
Finally he surveyed himself in the mirror. Just
what he resembled, with the haversack on his back
and the football against his stomach, he couldn’t
decide, but, at least, he looked different! Fortunately,
perhaps, he had but one more recitation
before dinner and one after, and at neither of
them was he asked to explain his singular likeness
to a peddler, for the story had reached even to the
ears of the faculty. At dinner his arrival in hall
was even a greater personal triumph than last
evening, but he didn’t mind the razzing a bit. Being
the sensation of the hour was compensation
enough!</p>

<p>To Mr. Cade, who dwelt outside the campus,
the tidings had not reached, and so at three-thirty,
when Bus paraded onto the field, trailed by a
throng of expectant team-mates, the coach was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
prepared for the spectacle. Bus was appropriately
attired in gray canvas pants, gray jersey,
gray-and-gold striped stockings, scuffed shoes and
hip pads, and he swung a black leather head guard.
But he also wore a battered football in front and
a mildewed canvas bag at his back, a bag on which
appeared in faded black characters the inscription
“Troop II, B.S.A.” Bus invited notice and won
it instantly.</p>

<p>“Lovell, you might rid yourself of that football
during practice,” said Mr. Cade, laughing a little.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Bus moved toward the wheelbarrow,
where the balls awaited distribution in a
big canvas sack, thereby presenting a rear view
to the coach. Mr. Cade stared. Wide grins overspread
the faces of the players.</p>

<p>“What’s he got on his back?” the coach demanded
in puzzled tones of Coles Wistar. Coles
choked and turned aside. The coach looked more
puzzled, and then suspicious. “Lovell!” he
called.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?” Bus returned, freed of the football.</p>

<p>“What”—Mr. Cade pointed—“is that contraption?”</p>

<p>“Haversack, sir. The Ancient World is inside.”</p>

<p>“The ancient—<em>what</em>?”</p>

<p>“World, sir,” answered Bus gravely. Every
one else was shouting with laughter by now. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Cade laughed, too, suspecting that Bus had contrived
a joke to turn the tables.</p>

<p>“The ancient world, eh? So you’re Atlas. Is
that it? Come clean, Lovell. What’s the point?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t do very well in Greek History class
this morning, Mr. Cade, and Mr. Kincaid said I
was to carry West’s Ancient World around with
me, sir. Just like the football, you know. He said
I fumbled too many questions.” Bus was grinning
now. Mr. Cade’s face was a study for a moment.
Then he chuckled, and then he laughed, and
laughed until the tears came.</p>

<p>“He wins, Lovell,” he gasped finally. “Take it
off. That’s a good one!”</p>

<p>“Think I’d better, sir?” asked Bus doubtfully.
“He said—”</p>

<p>Mr. Cade wiped his eyes. “I think it’s safe,”
he answered. “I—I’ll assume responsibility,
Lovell. And, Lovell.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?”</p>

<p>“Just so that Mr. Peghorn doesn’t follow suit
and hang a glass retort about your neck, we’ll
say no more about the football. I—I know when
I’m beaten, Lovell!”</p>

<p>Bus removed the haversack with a sigh of relief.
“I guess the football’s done its bit, anyway,
sir,” he said earnestly. “If I fumble again, Mr.
Cade, I—I’ll eat the fool thing!”</p>

<p>They set about preparing for the Kenly game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
that afternoon. Only one contest intervened, that
with Alton High School next Saturday, and that
was frankly only a practice engagement. From
now on every minute of the daily sessions on the
gridiron and of the nightly “skull-drills” in the
gymnasium would be devoted to the laudable ambition
of defeating Kenly Hall. There was a
twenty-minute encounter with the long-suffering
tackling dummy and much punting and running
back of punts before the formation drill began.
Bert found himself opposite Storer on the squad
that followed Ted Ball up and down the field.
Walsh was on Bus Lovell’s squad, where, too, at
his old position at the tip of the right wing, Chick
was holding forth. Chick and Shelfer were dividing
that honor of late, with Chick showing far
more of finished playing and Shelfer impressing
the coaches by his sheer determination. I say
coaches, because a former Alton player named
Lake had arrived and was giving his serious attention
to the linemen, the guards and tackles especially.
Still later that week two other graduates
showed up, but they remained only a few days and
spent more time exchanging reminiscences on the
side-lines than in actual coaching. However, their
counsel was valuable to Mr. Cade, and they really
did help in the evenings, when the blackboard was
hauled out on the gymnasium floor and the plays
were drawn thereon and the players, rubber-soled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
walked and trotted through them. The new signals
were being learned, and that alone was a very
fair task, especially for two or three of the squad
whose memories were not of the best. There were
eleven line plays inside the ends, six outside, three
forward-passes and one punt. These were numbered
from 2 to 25, inclusive, omitting 10, 11, 20
and 21. Any number ending in 0 signified a punt.
Two series, one of two plays and one of three, were
indicated by the numbers 11 and 21. To commit
these to memory was a task that called for real
concentration.</p>

<p>This Tuesday there were many mistakes made,
and Bert made his share. Twice he confused Number
8 and Number 13. The former play was left
half through left tackle and the latter was left end
around right end, and there was no similarity
either in the numbers or the plays. Yet Bert for
some, perhaps psychological, reason got mixed
badly. It was well toward the end of the week before
he rid himself of the haunting fear that he
would forever confuse 8 and 13!</p>

<p>However, quarter-backs and coaches were lenient
to-day; the former, perhaps, because they
were none too certain themselves of the new signals.
Even Ted Ball, who had won the reputation
of being a shark at calling signals, faltered more
than once. Mr. McFadden, who had scouted Kenly
Hall several times during the season, came over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
at four-fifteen with a team drilled in Kenly plays,
and most of the rest of the session was given over
by the First to defensive work. Whether the Second
had really perfected itself in the rival’s style
and methods was problematical, but certain it is
that the First experienced no great difficulty in
stopping the Scrub, even when Mr. Cade gave the
ball to the latter on the First’s ten-yard line.
Bert played through one ten-minute period of the
scrimmage and comported himself well enough to
win a word of commendation from Mr. Lake, who,
with Mr. Cade, hovered about the team like a
sternly anxious hen over a brood of young chicks.</p>

<p>“That’s the game, What’s-your-name! Don’t
start off blind, but wait till you see where the
play’s coming. You stopped that nicely, fellow!”</p>

<p>Bert stopped more than one ambitious Scrub
back during his ten minutes of service, or helped
stop them, and suffered painful if honorable
wounds in consequence. But he didn’t mind while
he was in. Only after he had been relegated to the
bench to make way for Walsh, did he fully appreciate
his injuries. Then he went over to Jake and
had two fingers taped together above a splint and
a nice square of plaster applied to his left cheek.
The Scrub in its imitation of Kenly was doing
a conscientious job!</p>

<p>Walsh stayed in only some four minutes and
then yielded to Keys. Walsh was plainly proving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
rather a disappointment to the coach. He had
weight and was a hard fellow to stop when he got
well started, but he was almost phenomenally slow
and, to-day at least, mixed signals badly. Bert
wasn’t afraid of Walsh nowadays, but he was
afraid of Keys. It seemed to Bert that Keys was
bound to have the call for right half-back position
by Saturday; and it was a fair assumption that
whoever played on the first-string against Alton
High would start the game against Kenly. Of
course Keys wouldn’t play the big game through,
and sooner or later, Bert assured himself, he, Bert,
would get in. But sometimes a back had the good
fortune to stick it out right to the end, or to within
a few minutes of it, and Bert wasn’t going to be
satisfied with merely saying, “How do you do?
Good-by!” to the referee. He watched rather
glumly while Keys performed the duties of a half-back
and credited Larry with doing considerably
better than he really did.</p>

<p>Chick played a full period and showed himself
superior to Fitz Savell as a defensive end. Unfortunately,
though, he erased whatever good impression
he may have made on the coaches when he
failed miserably just at the end of the scrimmage
to get into position for Galvin’s long throw down
the field. Chick confessed later that he mistook
the signal.</p>

<p>Neither side scored that afternoon and the battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
ended with honors fairly even when it was almost
too dark to see the ball ten yards away. Jake
fussed and grumbled a good deal during the succeeding
half hour, for it seemed that about every
other man on the two teams had managed to get
himself hurt in some fashion. The injuries were
only casual and to be expected, but Jake, swashing
iodine around and snipping tape, was a growling
pessimist. At this rate, he confided to his grinning
patients, there wouldn’t be a whole team left by a
week from Saturday!</p>

<p>The evening sessions for the First Team interfered
badly with Chick’s pool program. Mr. Cade
generally dismissed them by eight-thirty, although
you couldn’t count on it, but that left Chick only an
hour in which to subjugate Mr. Devore and retrieve
his losses, and an hour wasn’t nearly
enough. So Chick, by Wednesday of that week,
was tiptoeing into Number 21 around eleven
o’clock, which was a very risky proceeding and
one not calculated to sending him leaping out of
bed, bright-eyed and refreshed, at seven o’clock
the next morning. But getting even with Lester
Devore had become almost an obsession with
Chick, and school laws and training rules were
forgotten. Bert was always fast asleep long before
the truant returned, although he sometimes
awoke enough to realize that his room-mate was
moving about and to wonder what time it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>It was on Thursday that Bert, finding mail in the
box downstairs, tossed a letter across the table to
Chick with the remark: “If you’re expecting any
freight, Charles, it has arrove.” Chick looked
at the corner of the buff envelope, which bore the
name of the railroad followed by the legend
“Freight Department,” and scowled. Bert busied
himself with a letter of his own until an indignant
exclamation from the other caught his attention.</p>

<p>“What a nerve!” growled Chick. “Wants me
to pay him ten dollars right away because he’s ‘got
use for the money’! Maybe I haven’t got use for
it, too; or would if I had it! Why didn’t he say
something about it last night?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s Devore writing to you, eh?” said
Bert. “Well, see here, Chick, can’t you pay what
you owe him and then keep away from him for
a while? How much is it, anyway? Only ten?”</p>

<p>Chick shrugged, hesitated and answered: “No,
it’s more than that, counting last night. It’s—it’s
sixteen-twenty-five now.”</p>

<p>Bert whistled. “How much have you got?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“About three and a half. And I owe you—”</p>

<p>“Never mind what you owe me. I’ve got five—no,
about four-fifty. That’ll make eight. Borrow
a couple somewhere and get it to him. After all,
he’s got a right to it, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“You lend me a couple and I’ll pay him five,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
said Chick. “That’s enough for him. He knows
he’ll get it all when I have it. I wouldn’t be owing
him so much if he didn’t always say, ‘Oh, that’s all
right. Pay when you get ready!’ I tried to get
ten from the old man, but he’s as tight as a bow-string,
hang it. Wrote back that I was thirty dollars
overdrawn already! Gosh, he keeps track of
every sou he lets go of! Next dad I have won’t be
a banker, I’ll bet!”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s two,” said Bert, “and for goodness’
sake put some more with it and hush him
up. And for Pete’s sake, Chick, stop playing pool
with him until you get yourself squared. What
time did you come wandering in last night, anyway?
It seemed like the middle of the night to
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it wasn’t that bad,” said Chick. “Thanks
for this, Bert. That makes six fifty, doesn’t it?
You’ll have to remember because I’m likely to forget.
I’ll slip over to Mooney’s after dinner and
leave it for him.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t he have any home?” inquired Bert.
“Doesn’t sleep at Mooney’s, too, does he?”</p>

<p>“He says leave it at Mooney’s,” answered
Chick, “so that’s what I’ll do. I hope he chokes!”</p>

<p>“Well,” murmured Bert, “I won’t go that far,
but hanged if I’d loosen the knot if he was choking!”</p>

<small>PEANUTS AND CONVERSATION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Thursday afternoon saw a slight let-up on the
field. Preliminary work was lighter and so much
time was spent on signal drill that there was only
enough daylight left for one scrimmage period.
That, however, went to fifteen minutes. Coach
Cade used all his second-string players before the
fracas was over, which means that both Bert and
Keys served as right, or Number 2, half-back.
Chick, also, saw service and did better than he had
done before that week. The Second Team stuck
to what they fondly believed were Kenly formations
and plays and, while these went fairly well
in midfield they petered out nearer the goal line.
Second got a nice placement kick over, but failed
to score a touchdown. First, using a more diversified
attack than it had shown all season, twice
crossed the adversary’s line. There were several
forward-passes that went smoothly for short
gains, two of them received by Chick; one long
heave, Galvin to Kruger, that was good for twenty-two
yards; some well-placed punts by Nip Storer
and some good gains by the backs. The most
startling performance by the First, however, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
an end-around play featuring Fitz Savell. Fitz
shot outside left end and reeled off thirty-four
yards before he was stopped by the Scrub’s safety
man. Bert made two gains of seven and eleven
yards respectively on off-tackle plays and once
made a shorter though timely romp to a first down
outside end. Galvin and Storer first, and then
Ness and Couch, accounted for many advances
through the line. On the whole the First showed
power, speed and smoothness of execution; although
it must be confessed that Bus Lovell, who
followed Ted as general, had much difficulty with
his signals and slowed up the playing considerably
on occasions. What Bus did not do, however, was
fumble!</p>

<p>There was a cheer meeting that evening in Assembly
Hall—there had been two or three previously—and
Bert and Chick joined the throng and
sang and shouted as heartily as any. Mr. Fowler,
the English instructor and head of the Faculty
Committee on Athletics, addressed the meeting
and kept it laughing for twenty minutes. (“Gee,”
murmured Chick, “why can’t he be like this in
class?”) Mr. Cade said a few words and was followed
by Captain Jonas Lowe. Jonas was just as
much at home on a platform, just as much at ease
addressing an audience, as a cow on a tight-rope.
He arose in painful embarrassment and lurched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
to the front with the enthusiasm of a malefactor
approaching the electric chair. Then he put his
large hands in the pockets of his capacious
trousers, cleared his throat and took his hands out
again. By that time the applause had dwindled
to comparative silence, a silence punctured by
chuckles and snickers of amusement. Jonas
clasped his hands tightly behind him, rocked backward
on his heels and frowned furiously. Then
he spoke. Fearful, perhaps, that he wouldn’t make
himself heard, he opened his remarks in a voice
that, as husky as it was, might easily have been
heard on the far side of Haylow Hall.</p>

<p>“Fellows! And gentlemen! You know why
you’re here—why I’m here. I’ve got to say something
about the Team and about licking Kenly
Hall. Well, that’s all right. We’ll do it. [Enthusiastic
applause mingled with laughter.] We’ll
lick Kenly. We’ve got a pretty good bunch this
year and—and we’ve been well coached. Mr. Cade
is a great guy. [More applause.] Of course Kenly’s
got a pretty good bunch, too. That’s what
they tell us, anyway. But we’ve got a pretty good—I
mean, our team’s all right, too. Got a good,
strong line and a bunch of clever backs. Fellows
like Jim Galvin and Nip Storer and—and others.
Got a center you can’t beat, Lum Patten. Lum’s
a great guy. [Cheers and laughter.] Got a pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
of fine tackles. Got good ends. Got some corking
plays. And we’re all fit. Got to thank Jake for
that. Jake’s a great trainer. [Cheers for Jake.]
So we’re all set, like I told you, to play the best
game we know how, and if Kenly beats us it’s
going to be a big surprise to them, I guess. It will
be to me, anyway. But she won’t do it. You guys—you
fellows do your part and we’ll do ours.
That’s fair enough. Got to have the support of the
School. Got to know we have it. Helps a lot.
Plenty of cheering, you know. Everybody in line
for a victory. That’s the idea. All together in the
right spirit. Lots of it, too. Well, that’s all.
We’ve got a pretty good bunch and we’ll do the
best we know how. Much obliged.”</p>

<p>Jonas, perspiring freely, retired to his seat
amidst loud acclaim and Freeman Naughton called
for “a cheer for Captain Lowe, fellows, and make
it good!” After that they sang a few more songs,
cheered the Team vociferously and departed.</p>

<p>Bert and Chick joined forces with “Judge”
Anstruther, Billy Haines and Hank Howard and
wandered into Upton and up to the assistant
manager’s room. Judge could do weird and wonderful
things on a strange looking contraption
that was about half-way between a guitar and a
mandolin—with leanings toward several other instruments—and
they had a musical evening. Hank
Howard proclaimed his ability to play beautifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
on a harmonica and Billy Haines disappeared and
returned with one a minute or two later. After
that, although Billy knew almost none of the tunes
that Judge knew, the program took on an added
interest. About the only thing the two performers
could thoroughly get together on was that ribald
composition, “Oh, Doctor!” This was a rimed
insult set to music which Alton had once sung at
the football games with Kenly. Of late it had
become taboo, however, and when it sometimes
threatened to break out it was quickly suppressed
by the cheer leaders. On such occasions as this,
though, “Oh, Doctor!” might be sung to the
heart’s content without frantic “shushings.” So
with Judge Anstruther beating the strings of his
exotic instrument and Billy swaying ecstatically
with his hands cupped about the borrowed harmonica
the others sang loudly:</p>

<p>By the end of the first verse reënforcements had
appeared from neighboring rooms, and when the
song had been concluded the applause was so
hearty and insistent that the musicians had to
begin again. As the room was now filled to capacity
the encore completely drowned the music. A
rumor that Mr. Offerman was on his way upstairs
finally reduced the chorus to its original number
and sent Judge Anstruther into the gentle strains
of an Hawaiian melody. Mr. Offerman, however,
didn’t materialize and the party broke up in a
disappointed mood.</p>

<p>The weather, which had been on the whole particularly
obnoxious for a fortnight, changed during
Thursday night, and when Friday dawned the
world was drenched in a gray mist, the air was
balmy and one rather expected to hear bluebirds
cheeping or cawing or whatever it is that bluebirds
do. Chill, cloudy days, cold, blustery days were
no more for the while and Indian summer had returned
from over the purple hills. By the time
breakfast was over the haze had vanished under
the warmth of an ardent sun and brick walks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
stone walls were steaming gently. Groups of
boys crowded the dormitory steps, windows were
open, with curtains aflutter, and the campus grass
seemed to have grown a full shade greener under
its sere and yellow tips. Of course no one wanted
to do any work. That’s the trouble with such
days. A fellow just wants to stick his hands deep
into his pockets and lean against something—if he
can’t sit down—and think long and lazy thoughts,
thoughts on any subject save study and recitations
and English themes due at noon and letters postponed
since Sunday. It’s an effort even to yawn!</p>

<p>Fortunately practice was light that afternoon,
for even the most ambitious were unable to move
out of a walk unless driven to it by the sharp voice
of authority. Footballs had a way of coming
down yards distant from their expected landing
places and of slipping out of nerveless fingers,
and cleated football shoes had apparently added
several pounds of weight since yesterday. There
was no scrimmage, and after a signal drill of half
an hour the squad was released. Most of the First
Team repaired to the second gridiron after getting
back into mufti and watched the Scrub play its one
outside game of the season. Southport Second
was the opponent. Bert, his feet over the back of
the seat in front of him, basked in the warmth and
took much pleasure in watching his recent opponents
in practice pant and perspire as they charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
over the gridiron. For once at least he was content
to sit in idleness and watch others gain the glory.
Beyond him, widely spaced since there was plenty
of room on the stand to-day and the idea of contact
with another was obnoxious in such weather,
sat other members of the First, lazily, even somnolently.
Occasional words of approval aimed at
the Second seldom reached the field. You might
have all the will in the world to shout loudly, yet
what resulted was merely a sleepy murmur. Into
Bert’s paradise of contentment crept the serpent.</p>

<p>Well, he didn’t exactly creep, either; stumble
would be a better word. And for a serpent he was
undeniably rotund. Perhaps likening him to a boa
constrictor after a hearty meal might go unchallenged,
but the simile is inapt. And this particular
serpent, even if he had had a hearty meal, was still
eating as he flopped down to a seat beside Bert
with a muttered: “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saluer, mon brave!</i>”</p>

<p>“’Lo, Tommy,” responded Bert weakly.
“That’s rotten French.”</p>

<p>“Sure. Have a peanut?” Tommy extended a
sack and Bert managed to raise his hand and dip
into it. “Some weather, eh? Feel like a lotus
eater. Couldn’t find any lotuses—or is it lotii?—and
had to get peanuts.”</p>

<p>“Penii,” corrected Bert.</p>

<p>Tommy grinned and tried to hit Watkins, of
the Scrub, on the head with a shell. His effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
fell short and he sighed. “Who’s ahead?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Second. Two quarts.”</p>

<p>“Two quarts of what?”</p>

<p>“Perspiration. Scrubs just claimed a foul on
Southport, but the referee wouldn’t allow it.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Tommy. “I’ll bite. What
was the foul, Mister Johnsing?”</p>

<p>“Southport trainer gave them sweet spirits of
nitre to increase their—er—humidity. Clearly
against the rules.”</p>

<p>Tommy viewed him anxiously. “Better move
back into the shade,” he advised. “Gee, I didn’t
realize the sun was so hot! No scoring yet, eh?”</p>

<p>“No. Where’s your hat, Tommy?”</p>

<p>“Ate it.” That was Tommy’s invariable answer
to the pesky question. “Help yourself.”</p>

<p>Bert groaned and dipped again. “Do you ever
stop eating?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Frequently. No practice for you guys to-day?”</p>

<p>“How do you mean, no practice?” said Bert indignantly.
“We were at it four hours. Anyway,
it seemed that long. How come you weren’t on
hand with your invaluable advice, Tommy?”</p>

<p>“I was doing a composition and fell asleep.
Woke up with my fountain pen stuck in my left
ear. Dreamed I was being hung.”</p>

<p>“I don’t get the relationship between the dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and the—whatyoucallit—actuality,” sighed Bert.</p>

<p>“Nor I—at first. Guess the pen sticking into
said ear suggested hangman’s knot. Don’t they
put the knot against the left ear?”</p>

<p>“Honest, I forget. Seems, to me, though, the last
time I was hung it was under my chin, but maybe
it slipped. Here goes for a touchdown.”</p>

<p>“Bet you!”</p>

<p>“You’re on for a bag of peanuts.”</p>

<p>Bert lost, for Southport got her back up and
selfishly refused to let the Alton Scrub left tackle
through the center, although all the latter asked
was a scant two yards. After Southport had
punted from behind her goal line the whistle blew,
faintly as though exhausted, and the half was at
an end. The shadow of the roof crept over the
front of the stand and Bert perked up a bit.</p>

<p>“How are you betting on the Kenly game,
Tommy?” he asked. “Still bearish?”</p>

<p>“No, and never was. I said right along that
we’d beat ’em if Johnny Cade tumbled to himself
and you fellows humped yourselves a bit. We’ll
win by a couple of scores next week.”</p>

<p>“What? I thought you were predicting total
ruination, Tommy. What’s changed the colossal
mind?”</p>

<p>“Well, for one thing Johnny went and got rid of
a lot of stiffs like Tate and Meecham and your
babyhood friend, Chick Burton.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wrong, Tommy. Chick’s got a good chance to
play, I guess.”</p>

<p>“You’re a rotten guesser, Bert. Oh, he might
get in for a little old minute or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">deux</i>.”</p>

<p>“No, I mean for the whole <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soixante</i>, young chap;
anyway for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la plupart</i>.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tant s’en faut</i>,” responded Tommy, “meaning
you’re talking foolishment. Chick’s no use this
year, Bert, and Johnny’s discovered it. You know
it, too, just as well as I do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, why pick on Chick? Of course he’s
had his bad days, but so have all of them.”</p>

<p>“Not so <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mal</i> as Chick’s,” said Tommy decidedly.
“If I thought there was any chance of Johnny
using Chick Burton against Kenly I’d—”</p>

<p>“What would you do, son?” asked Bert amusedly.</p>

<p>“Put a stop to it.”</p>

<p>Bert laughed. “Tommy, you’re delicious! Pass
the peanuts. How would you go about it, young
fellow?”</p>

<p>Tommy wagged his head knowingly and screwed
up his eyes as one who could tell but wouldn’t.
“Never you mind,” he murmured. “I could do
it.”</p>

<p>“Who’s had a touch of the sun now?” jeered
Bert. “Sounds like you and Johnny are pretty
thick. Does everything you say, eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Monsieur Alexandre <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’habile</i>!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
(Bert groaned in protest.) “I’m not talking
through my hat—”</p>

<p>“That is to be seen,” murmured Bert. “Though
why you didn’t say <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chapeau</i>—”</p>

<p>“And if I had to, if it was necessary for the—the
success of the Team, I could put a spoke in
Burton’s wheel all right, all right!”</p>

<p>Bert frowned. “Don’t talk silly, Tommy! Just
what are you getting at, anyway?”</p>

<p>But Tommy shook his head again, filled his
mouth with peanuts and looked suddenly extremely
secretive, even stupid. Bert grunted. “That sort
of talk isn’t nice, Tommy. Better lay off.”</p>

<p>“All right.” Tommy used a superior tone that
made the other frown again. “’Nough said.
Have a peanut. Go on. I’ve got another bag coming
to me.”</p>

<p>Bert declined, and after a minute he asked:
“What other reason have you for changing the
old mind? Besides the changes in the team, I
mean.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve seen Kenly play, for another
thing.”</p>

<p>“You have? When?”</p>

<p>“Last Saturday. Goodall and I went over.”</p>

<p>“How were they?” asked Bert eagerly.</p>

<p>“Good. They’ve got a nice-looking gang.”</p>

<p>“Well, then—”</p>

<p>“But we can beat them if we play lively football.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
They’re sort of—well, not exactly slow, but—now
what’s the word?”</p>

<p>“Use your French,” advised Bert.</p>

<p>“Don’t have to. Uninspired’s what I wanted.
That’s how they struck me. They looked like a
team that could drag a heavy load all day but
wouldn’t have sense—no, imagination enough to
run away!”</p>

<p>“Run away! Why should they run away?”</p>

<p>“I was speaking metaphorically,” said Tommy
with dignity. “What I mean is, those guys will do
what the coach tells them to do all right, but they
haven’t—aren’t— Now, look here, you know as
well as I do that there’s such a thing as football
sense—or something. When a team hasn’t got it
and runs against something that isn’t—er—provided
for, if you see what I’m trying to get at—”</p>

<p>“You’re talking about self-reliance, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I mean those guys aren’t the sort to rise
to the occasion. They lack football—football—”</p>

<p>“Instinct!”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” said Tommy relievedly. “Instinct.
And initiative, too. I guess initiative’s what I’ve
been trying to think of.”</p>

<p>“And you think we have those things?”</p>

<p>“Yes, most of you have. You have, for one. So
has Ted Ball and Nip Storer and Galvin and
Kruger and—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gosh, I don’t believe I have, Tommy! Ted,
yes; and maybe those others. But me—” Bert
shook his head doubtfully. “Anyway, how can
you tell by seeing a team in action once whether
it’s got initiative, Tommy?”</p>

<p>“I can,” answered the other stoutly. “It shows
in the way they go about things, the way they
handle themselves. You can’t fool me. Say, did
I tell you that you were good and that you’d make
the team or didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“You did,” acknowledged Bert.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I said you’d do most of the scoring
against Kenly, too, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Something of the sort. Don’t you wish you
hadn’t?”</p>

<p>“No. Things generally come out the way I say
they’re going to, Bert. You wait until a week from
to-morrow and then tell me if I was right or
wrong.”</p>

<p>“I will, Tommy. And I’ll do this, too. If you
prove right I’ll buy you enough peanuts to last
you to Christmas!”</p>

<p>Tommy chuckled. “Better not get rash, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon
demi-derrière</i>. I get awfully hungry when cold
weather comes. Besides, you might pay that bet
first!”</p>

<p>“Shut up! Here’s a dime. Go eat yourself to
death.”</p>

<p>“Better give me another and be on the safe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
side,” laughed Tommy. “Here they come again.
Go on in there, you mutts, and do something!”
Tommy’s voice arose to something approaching its
wonted penetration and vehemence, and the stand
spoke approval and encouragement.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff, Tommy! You tell ’em, boy!”</p>

<p>Tommy looked over his shoulder, grinned and
shot a peanut at the nearest speaker. “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fermer
votre</i> trap, Hink!” he admonished.</p>

<p>Possibly Mr. McFadden had talked like a Dutch
uncle during intermission. At all events, the Second
Team came back strong and played a rather
different brand of football during the third and
most of the fourth quarter. The stand woke up
and cheered encouragement and Tommy offered
caustic criticism, and the Alton Scrub marched on
to glory. Glory was represented by a single touchdown,
minus the point which should have followed,
and one field-goal. The touchdown came soon
after the resumption of hostilities in the third
period and the field-goal closed the ceremonies in
the fourth. Between the two events Southport
made a determined but fruitless effort to score and
hurled passes to all points of the compass. Tommy
observed disgustedly that they’d wear out the sod,
throwing the ball around on it like that. From
which you are to understand that the passes were
usually not completed.</p>

<p>Chick had gone to the room directly after practice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
announcing a virtuous resolve to do some
studying that football—and other interests—had
interfered with, but when Bert reached Number
21 he found the student sound asleep on the window-seat,
an open book astride his chest.</p>

<p>The “Flubdub,” which had been mildly disapproving
of the coach and the conduct of football affairs,
changed its tune in the issue of that week. It
found many complimentary things to say of the
Team and it insinuated that those who had been
criticizing Mr. Cade and his methods had formed
their verdict too soon. The games with Oak Grove
and Mt. Millard, declared the paper, proved that,
in spite of certain discouraging aspects visible
early in the season, Alton football was in a healthy
condition, and that although progress had been
slow it had also been sure. The “Flubdub,” in
short, was suddenly optimistic and didn’t care who
knew it.</p>

<p>On another page, however, was printed a comparison
of the Alton and Kenly Hall teams based
on their season’s records that seemed to provide
scant grounds for optimism. Both elevens had
played six games so far, Kenly had won five and
lost one, scoring 114 points to the opponents’ 45.
Alton had won three games, lost two and tied one,
scoring 63 points to the opponents’ 35. It might
have been claimed for the latter that her schedule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
had been slightly more difficult, but the claim
wouldn’t have been easy of proof. Kenly had met
but three teams which had played Alton, and aside
from those there was no basis for comparative
scores.</p>

<p>Alton took the High School contest on Saturday
not at all seriously, viewing it purely as a practice
game. She did, however, hope to meet with
enough opposition to try out her defense. The
High School eleven was completing a fairly successful
season, and, while it was a light team, it
was reputed to be fast and to be well handled by
a clever quarter, a lad named Forster, who, it was
hoped and expected, would enter Alton next Fall.
Mr. Cade started the game with his first-string
players on duty. Keys played right half, displacing
Walsh who now seemed to be out of the running
as a first-choice back. Toward the middle of
the second period the coach began to make changes
in the line-up, however, and before the half ended
more second-string than first-string fellows were
on the field. Bert substituted Keys while the second
quarter had some six minutes to go and when
High School, by some fast and tricky running
plays, had carried the pigskin to Alton’s twenty-one
yards. At about the same period Joe Tate
took Dutch Kruger’s place. Dutch had been fooled
frequently, his end of the line proving High
School’s best bet. Joe took hold in good style and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
spoiled the next attempt around his position, and,
after High School had tried a forward-pass into
the zone and failed at it, she faked a drop-kick and
smashed at the left guard position, her full-back
carrying. Nat Wick was carried out by the interference
and the full-back shot through for all but
two yards of the required distance. On fourth
down the same play was tried again, the point of
attack this time being at the left of center. Certain
that a kick was really forthcoming, Alton allowed
herself to be caught napping and the High School
plunger was through before the secondary defense
rallied. It was Bert, coming in hard and fast, who
nailed the enemy. He couldn’t stop the full-back,
though, until Patten, breaking loose from the interference,
crashed into them both. It was that
timely aid that laid Bert out flat for the whole two
minutes, with every atom of breath on a vacation.
While he recuperated with the aid of Jake the
chain was brought in and the distance measured.
High School had failed of a first down by some
four inches! Alton speedily kicked out of danger,
and for the rest of the playing time Bert was
rather too done up to do himself justice. Bus
Lovell, though, was easy on him and his duties
were chiefly defensive until just before time was
called for the half. Then a split play with Bert
carrying inside tackle was sprung, and Bert, conscious
of being still somewhat limp, and nervously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
fearing he might mess the play up, started too
soon, was forced to slow up for the pass and
reached the line “on the wrong foot.” A High
School forward nailed him for no gain. Before
Bus could call his signals again the whistle blew,
and Bert, for once, was glad to hear it.</p>

<p>Yet Coach Cade let him go back when the third
quarter started and he played well into the last
period and accounted for one long gain and several
short ones. He brought the Alton sympathizers
to their feet when he took a forward-pass from
Galvin well off toward the side of the field—Savell
had gone in back of the enemy center as if to catch
there—and dodged his way over four white streaks
before he was upset. Forty-three yards he raced
for a forty-seven-yard gain, and after he had released
the ball on High School’s nine yards it took
Galvin just two plunges to carry it across. That
tackle, though, had about finished Bert so far as
present usefulness was concerned, and Coach Cade
took him out after the score had been made, and
Larry Keys went back in.</p>

<p>That was Alton’s third score, for she had gone
over the High School line twice in the third period.
It also proved to be her last, and the final figures
were 20 to 0. On the whole, in spite of two scares,
Alton had not had much difficulty with the adversary.
Nor had she been provided with much work
for her line on defense, since High School had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
early recognized the futility of attacks inside the
tackles. In one way, though, the home team had
profited. She had been shown that her ends were
not yet good enough to cope with a really fast and
clever running game. Joe Tate had shown up better
on defense than any of the other three ends
who had been tried that afternoon, and it was
predicted that he would displace Dutch at the left
wing. The prediction proved wrong, however, for
Dutch continued to hold the position, doubtless in
recognition of his offensive ability. As for Bert,
he went back to Upton convinced that, in spite of
that one fortunate stunt, he had finally and conclusively
lost out to Keys in the struggle. He was
rather silent, a fact not apparently noticed by
Chick, since Chick was silent too.</p>

<p>Chick had played during nearly a half of the
game and had done poorly, and he knew it and was
at once puzzled and resentful. All the fall he had
made light of his derelictions, convinced of his
ability to play as good football as he had last
season. It was Chick’s secret contention that
Coach Cade should be as convinced of the fact as
he himself was and so view occasional failures with
a lenient eye. Now, however, Chick had begun
to doubt. To-day he had earnestly and whole-heartedly
tried to be the old Chick again, to show
Johnny and all the others who had been viewing
him askance that when it pleased him to he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
play the end position as it should be played; even
a little better! And he had failed. And he didn’t
know why he had failed. Time and again runs
had gone around him, time and again he had been
put completely out of the play. And this not
against a strong team but against a confessedly
mediocre one! He tried to understand it and
failed. Or almost. He finally entertained the
theory that not his body but his mind had played
him false. Looking back it seemed that his former
ability to diagnose the play and act quickly had
been lacking. And it came to him that, despite
earlier indifference, he now wanted intensely to
make good in this his last year of Alton football!</p>

<p>There was no evening session in the gymnasium
this Saturday night and Chick had tentatively
agreed to accompany Bert and two others to a lecture
in the auditorium. He wasn’t particularly interested
in excavations in Central America, but
Bert had pleaded and he had consented—with reservations.
Yet when Bert tried to find him at eight
o’clock he wasn’t to be found, and no one that
Bert enquired of could supply tidings of him.
Bert suspected that a trip to Mooney’s would reveal
the truant, but there was no time for that;
nor was there much inclination. Bert had become
rather disgusted with his chum’s inability to tear
himself from the society of Lester Devore.</p>

<p>Chick was a little out of patience with himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
that evening on the same score. It was foolish to
go back to Mooney’s and get plucked again, for he
would be plucked without a doubt. The idea that
he would one day succeed in winning back the
money he had lost—quite a considerable sum by
now, even if not all paid—had had to be abandoned.
Chick was at last satisfied that Devore was a better
pool player than he was. Also, he had a sneaking
suspicion that Devore had let him win on the infrequent
occasions when he had won merely to
coax him on to increasing his wagers. He wasn’t
convinced of it, for Devore could be disarmingly
frank and ingenuous when he tried to be, and it
was hard sometimes not to credit the sincerity of
his regret when the luck continued in his favor.
To-night Chick didn’t mean to play. He couldn’t
afford to, for one thing, for he had just twenty
cents in his pocket. He meant to look on awhile.
That would be a lot more interesting than hearing
some bespectacled old geezer ramble on about
the Incas, or whoever the folks were that used to
live a couple of billion years ago down in—oh,
that place where the chewing gum comes from!
Besides, Chick was in low spirits to-night, anyway,
and he sighed for lights and laughter and
the familiar sound of the clicking balls. Of course
Les might dun him for the money he still owed,
but a lot of good it would do him! You can’t get
blood from a stone!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>The lecture was interesting, but it was a bit too
long, and Bert, for one, got tired of staring at
stereopticon views thrown on a screen at the back
of the platform long before the entertainment
ended. He accompanied Ted Ball and Lum Patten
over to Lykes and when Lum insisted on their
coming into his room he went and stayed until
twenty minutes to ten. They talked a lot of football,
and Bert was surprised when Lum acknowledged
that he had hot and cold shivers whenever
he thought of the Kenly game. Bert had supposed
such evidences of nervousness confined to inexperienced
players like himself. Then Ted
chuckled and said: “I’ve never been able to sleep
more than three or four hours the night before a
big game, fellows. Sounds crazy, I know, but it’s
a fact. Last year Coles was up reading poetry to
me, Robert Frost’s, it was, for more than two
hours. He had a theory that poetry would put me
to sleep, but I guess he got hold of the wrong
brand. Say, I’ll bet that if I could get a solid eight
hours of sleep next Friday night I could play a
wicked game Saturday! But I shan’t. I’ll lie
awake for hours, going over signals, playing the
whole blamed game in advance, from beginning
to end, and wake up feeling like—like something
just out of the wringer! Wonder if I can get hold
of a bottle of soothing syrup!”</p>

<p>“I sleep pretty well,” confided the center, “and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
generally eat a good breakfast. But I sure hate
to think about the old game. Of course, after the
whistle toots and the ball’s in the air I’m all right.
But until then I just have to keep my mind off the
thing. How’s it take you, Bert?”</p>

<p>“That’s the funny part,” answered Bert in
puzzled tones. “I’d ought to be scared, but I
haven’t really thought much about it. Of course
last year I didn’t have any reason to worry, because
I didn’t have any idea of getting in. Perhaps
that’s why I’m not nervous now. I mean
there isn’t much chance of my starting the game,
and by the time I do get in I’ll be sort of used to it.
Maybe that isn’t very clear—”</p>

<p>“Fine thing to keep your nerve like that,” commented
Ted, “and I don’t want to say a thing to
shake you, Bert, but if you don’t start against
Kenly I—well, I’ll swallow the ball!”</p>

<p>Bert looked startled, then skeptical. He turned
a questioning glance toward Patten, but Lum
shook his head. “Don’t ask me,” he said. “I
don’t get to the conferences, Bert. ‘Mine but to
do or die.’”</p>

<p>“Well, I think he’s just trying to get my goat,”
said Bert, viewing Ted doubtfully. Ted grinned.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” chuckled Lum. “He’s fixing you
so you won’t be able to sleep either and can read
poetry to him for a couple of hours.”</p>

<p>When he reached Upton and was making his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
toward the staircase a boy of about eighteen came
toward him from the other end of the first floor
corridor. He wasn’t an Academy youth; that fact
was apparent even before he spoke.</p>

<p>“Say, Buddie, where’s Room 21, huh?”</p>

<p>“Next floor. Who do you want?”</p>

<p>“Guy name o’ Hollins. ’S he live here?”</p>

<p>“That’s me,” answered Bert. “What do you
want with me?”</p>

<p>The stranger looked suspicious. “How do I
know you’re the feller, huh? I got a message for
him. You show me where he lives, huh?”</p>

<p>“I tell you I’m Hollins,” declared Bert impatiently.
“Who’s the message from?”</p>

<p>The boy, who looked as if he ought to be hanging
around a down-town corner, looked dubious a
moment and then gave a shifty glance up and
down the corridor. Several doors were open and
there was a low hum of talk from the lighted
rooms, but no one else was within earshot. “All
right. Know a guy named Barton, or something?”</p>

<p>“Burton? Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, say, he wants you to leg it over to
Mooney’s. Know it, huh? Billiard joint over
on—”</p>

<p>“I know Mooney’s. What’s he want me for?
What’s the rest of the message?”</p>

<p>“That’s all. Just come over to Mooney’s. It
was Mike himself give me the word.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mike?” repeated Bert, puzzled.</p>

<p>“Yeah, Mike Mooney. I was goin’ by, see, an’
he calls me over. ‘Beat it up to the Acad’my, he
says, an’ find Upton Hall and tell a guy name o’
Hollins in Room 21 he’s wanted here. Tell him
Burton sent for him.’ I don’t know what’s up,
but I seen three or four guys standin’ ’round
on the inside an’ another guy sittin’ in a chair,
an’ I guess some one got hurt, huh?”</p>

<p>“Hurt!” exclaimed Bert. “All right, I’ll come.
You tell him—”</p>

<p>“Tell him nothin’! I’m goin’ home, see.”</p>

<p>The youth vanished and Bert instinctively
started up the stairs for his cap. Then, realizing
with dismay that it was already a quarter to ten,
he turned and hurried after the messenger.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>


<p>He made quick time down the walk to the gate,
through State street to West and so into the Saturday
night throngs. The messenger’s theory that
Chick had been hurt, alarming for the instant, was
soon discarded by Bert. What was far more probable
was that Chick had played pool again, lost
and was unable to meet his obligations. Probably
Mooney was holding him as hostage. Bert
frowned at the recollection that his present wealth
was represented by two silver quarters and one
nickel. If Chick’s indebtedness exceeded fifty-five
cents he was, Bert thought, likely to remain
a hostage!</p>

<p>Mooney’s was doing a land-office business when
Bert reached it. The long vista of green tables
was half shrouded in blue smoke through which
coatless players moved to and fro. The lines of
chairs on each side held almost uninterrupted rows
of spectators. The click of the ivory balls and the
tapping of cues were barely heard above the steady
bedlam of talk. Near the entrance a cigar case
and a desk met at an angle, and the square space
behind was used as a sort of office. Chick’s head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
was visible above the cigar case as Bert’s glance
roved away from the tables. Nearby stood a small,
wiry, leather-cheeked man whom Bert guessed to
be Mike Mooney. There were none others inside
the inclosure. Bert went forward and leaned
across the display of cigars.</p>

<p>“Did you send for me, Chick?” he asked.</p>

<p>Then he saw for the first time that Chick’s forehead
was swathed in a rough bandage and that
there was a large red stain against the white cloth.</p>

<p>“What happened?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Chick turned his head slowly and grinned. He
looked pale, and the grin was palpably effected
only after an effort. The proprietor interposed
briskly. “You his friend?” he asked Bert. “Well,
say, get him out of here, will you? It don’t
do my place no good to have him sittin’ around
like that.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, but—but what—how—”</p>

<p>“Shot off his mouth,” explained Mike in a lowered
voice. “Feller biffed him with a cue. I
didn’t see it, and I don’t know what they was
jawin’ about, but that’s how I got it. He’s all
right now. Sort of woozy, though, and you’d
better get a taxi, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I’ll walk,” said Chick, pulling himself from
his chair and wincing as he moved. “Sorry to
bother you, Bert, but I was a bit dizzy. Much
obliged to you, Mr. Mooney.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s all right, young feller, but listen to me,
will you? You play pool somewhere else, see? I
run a respectable place, and I don’t want no
trouble-makers in here, see? I ain’t saying whose
fault it was, mind, and I don’t care. And no hard
feelings, see? But I’d be just as pleased if you
kept away. And that goes for the other guy, too.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Chick wearily. “Come on,
Bert.”</p>

<p>Outside Bert asked anxiously: “Sure you’d better
not ride, Chick? It won’t take a minute to
find a cab.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather walk. The air feels good. Gosh,
that was a nasty thump he gave me!”</p>

<p>“<a href="#image04">Who did it? How did it happen?</a> Never mind
now, though. Better take my arm, old chap.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 390px;">
<a id="image04">
  <img src="images/image04.jpg" width="390" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_238">“Who did it? How did it happen?”</a></div>
</div>

<p>Chick accepted the suggestion and for a few minutes
they went slowly along the street, making
their way with difficulty through the throng.
Chick had set his cap on his head and it partly
covered the blood-soaked bandage, and so his appearance
attracted no attention. Presently, reaching
West street and less crowded sidewalks, Chick
began to talk.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s after ten, isn’t it? Afraid I’m
making a mess for you, Bert. Hope we don’t run
into a faculty.”</p>

<p>“Only a minute or two after,” answered Bert.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
“Keep your head down and we’ll make it, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“Afraid I can’t.” Chick attempted a chuckle.
“Have to hold it up, Bert. If I don’t it throbs
horribly. Have we got any arnica in the room?”</p>

<p>“I think so. If we haven’t I can find some easily
enough. Is it much of a cut?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but it feels a yard long. A fellow
bathed it in cold water and it hurt like the dickens.
I got sort of faint and Mooney asked if he couldn’t
send for some one to help me home and I told him
to send for you. I guess he was afraid I’d want
the ambulance and get the cops on the scene! How
did they find you? Were you in the room? Any
one hear about me?”</p>

<p>Bert explained as they went along State street
between buildings gradually changing from shops
to residences. Then: “You haven’t told me yet
who hit you, Chick.”</p>

<p>“Les Devore. He got nasty because I wouldn’t
play with him. I just went there to look on. I
only had twenty cents and I told him so, but he
said it didn’t matter, that I owed him a lot already
and a couple of dollars more wouldn’t matter. I
said he’d get his money all right, but I didn’t intend
to owe him any more. Then he got talking
for the other fellows to hear, razzing me about
my dad being a banker and not having any money,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and a lot of stuff like that. Making believe he was
joking, but mad just the same. Well, I called him
down finally and he came where I was sitting and
put his hand against my chin and knocked my head
back against a rack. Pretending he was just in
fun, you know. It hurt quite a bit and I jumped up
and hit him pretty hard. He went back against
the table and I went after him. He was scared
then and started to back around the other end, and
I told him to keep his mouth shut and went back
to sit down again. And just then some one yelled
‘Look out, kid!’ and I turned my head and got
his cue right here. It didn’t hit me square, you
see; sort of glanced off; but it put me out for the
count, I guess. When I came around I was down
there where you found me and some one was
sopping water all over me.”</p>

<p>“What became of Devore?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I suppose he beat it. I’m going
to find him to-morrow, though,” added Chick
grimly.</p>

<p>“Not to-morrow,” said Bert. “You won’t be
feeling very scrappy in the morning, Charles.
Just you leave— Oh! He-hello, Mr. Cade!”</p>

<p>“I thought that was you, Hollins. And Burton,
too, eh?”</p>

<p>“Good evening, sir,” muttered Chick.</p>

<p>They had reached the corner of State and Academy
streets. Neither of them had given thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
to the fact that the coach had his quarters in the
old white house there, although if they had they
would not have seriously considered the possibility
of such an adventure. Mr. Cade was leaning
over the gate, a pipe in his mouth, and since
the nearest street light was well distant they
hadn’t seen him until he had spoken. Now Chick
tugged at Bert’s arm, but the coach spoke again.</p>

<p>“Been to the movies, Hollins?” he asked conversationally.</p>

<p>“No, sir, just—just down town. It—it’s a nice
night, sir, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Splendid!” Mr. Cade sounded quite enthusiastic.
“Remarkable weather for the time of year.
A trifle too warm for football, of course, but then
every one doesn’t play football, eh?” Chick was
conscious that the coach was looking intently at
him in the half darkness, and again he tugged
imperatively at his companion’s arm.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” responded Bert vaguely, “it surely
is. Well, we’ll be getting—”</p>

<p>But just then there was a scratching sound and
a match flared. Mr. Cade held the flame to his
pipe, as he did so leveling his gaze across it in the
direction of Chick. Then the light went out and
a puff of smoke floated over the gate.</p>

<p>“What happened to your head, Burton?” asked
the coach quietly.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence. Then Chick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
answered confusedly: “Nothing much, sir. I—well,
I was in Mooney’s and there was a fellow in
there got to swinging his cue around and—”</p>

<p>“And you got in the way of it, eh? Hard luck.
Better come inside and let me look at it, I think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thanks, sir, but it’s quite all right! I’m
going to put some arnica on it when I get to the
room. It—it isn’t anything, really!”</p>

<p>“Probably not, but it seems to be still bleeding,
and if I were you I wouldn’t go up to the hall that
way.” The gate swung inward, Mr. Cade stood
aside, and, after a moment of hesitation, Chick
entered, followed by Bert. The coach occupied
two big rooms on the lower floor of the old house.
There was a living-room with a comfortably faded
carpet on the floor and furniture of the black walnut
age. On a big, round table, littered with magazines
and books and a dozen other objects, was a
wide-shaded electric lamp in whose radius of
mellow light stood a huge arm-chair, not of the
walnut period. Beyond was a sleeping room,
furnished with Spartan simplicity, while nearby,
across a narrow rear hall, was a bathroom. To
the latter Mr. Cade led the way.</p>

<p>“Now let’s have a look at it,” he said. Chick
seated himself on a white stool under the beams
of the light and the coach unwrapped the bandage.
“Hm, you did get a nasty swat, didn’t you? That
chap swung a mean cue! If it wasn’t so late I’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
advise you to get Jake in to dress that and put a
couple of stitches in it, but he’s probably fast
asleep. What time is it, Hollins?”</p>

<p>“Twelve minutes past, sir,” replied Bert uneasily.</p>

<p>“Past—”</p>

<p>“Ten.”</p>

<p>“Later than I thought. Well, I guess I can
strap that down with some plaster, Burton. I’ll
give it a good washing first.” He swung open
the door of a cabinet, selected a bottle from a shelf,
ran some water in the bowl and went to work
with absorbent cotton. “This may hurt a bit at
first,” he warned.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Chick stoically. “It’s been
hurting right along, sir.”</p>

<p>“There’ll be some swelling here in the morning,
and some one may be curious. Possibly you
had better say that you were calling on me this
evening. No need to go into details, you know.”</p>

<p>“Folks might think you gave it to him, sir,”
observed Bert in a weak attempt at humor.</p>

<p>“I guess not. I’ve felt rather murderous toward
this chap at times this fall, Hollins, but until
to-night I’ve managed to keep my hands off him.”
The coach smiled as he spoke, but neither boy
missed his meaning. “There you are, Burton.
I’m not going to put a bandage on it. It may
start to bleed again, but I don’t think it will. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
it does, just sop it off with some cotton and try
not to disturb the dressing.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.” Chick arose and looked at
himself in the glass. “Gee, I’m a sight! Look like
a pirate or something, don’t I?”</p>

<p>“Well, you look as if you’d come off second-best,”
chuckled the coach. He led the way back
to the living room. “How does it feel now?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Better, sir, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Head ache?”</p>

<p>“Like the dickens.”</p>

<p>“Better sit down awhile then before you go
up.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’d ought to beat it,” said Bert.
“It’s long after ten, and we’re supposed to be
inside at ten, sir.”</p>

<p>“After ten when you got here, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, a little.”</p>

<p>“I thought so. Well, you can say now that I
kept you. Take this chair, Burton, and put your
head back. Bring that chair over there up, Hollins.
Now I’m going to talk a little to this chap.
He’s feeling pretty rotten, and that’s an advantage
to me.”</p>

<p>Chick grinned, but looked uneasily across at
Bert. Mr. Cade busied himself with refilling and
lighting his briar pipe as he went on. “You know,
Burton, you haven’t been giving me a square deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
this fall. I was looking to you to do big things.
I thought you’d be a much better end than last
year, but you’ve let me down badly. I haven’t
complained, partly because I’ve been expecting
you’d come around, partly because I didn’t want
to start any unpleasantness. I saw quite early in
the season that you were carrying a chip on your
shoulder; why I don’t know; but I was careful not
to disturb it. It wouldn’t have done any good to
get you sore, old chap. Anyway, the way I doped
it, you’d play the game when you got ready and
not before. Of course I couldn’t wait for you after
mid-season. You wouldn’t expect me to. And,
as it has turned out, I was wise not to, for you
haven’t come back yet. And now, of course, you’re
not going to.”</p>

<p>The coach paused and the silence was deep.
Bert waited for Chick to defend himself, to offer
an excuse, an explanation, but Chick made no answer
and the coach went on. He had spoken easily,
without a suggestion of rancor, and he continued
in such manner.</p>

<p>“You’re going up to college next fall and, unless
you’ve changed your mind, to my college,
Burton. And I guess you mean to play football.
That’s right, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Chick in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you think you’re counting a whole
lot on my—my forbearance? Do you realize that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
if I wanted to be nasty—no, not even that; but if
I wanted to take my revenge—I could very easily
make it impossible for you to ever make a team
there? Ever think of that, Burton?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind. It’s a fact, though. But I
haven’t any desire to get back at you like that.
After all, while you’ve made things a bit more
difficult for me and have delayed the progress of
the team, you’ve been harder on yourself than
any one else, I guess. This is your last year here
and you’re not showing pretty. It’s a poor piece
of business for a First Team player to do so badly
in his last season that he has to sit on the bench
during the big game. And, frankly, Burton, as
things stand now, that’s what you’ll be doing Saturday.”</p>

<p>“That’s for you to say, of course,” said Chick
with some spirit, “but I don’t think I deserve that,
sir. I—I may have been pretty poor sometimes,
but I can still play better than Shelfer.”</p>

<p>“Can you? Perhaps you can. Yes, I’m sure you
can. But the point is, Burton, that you don’t!
And I’m bound to judge you by performance, my
boy. Perhaps you think it’s a low-down trick to
corner you when you’re feeling punk and say this
sort of thing, but it’s just because you are feeling
punk that I’m doing it.” Mr. Cade smiled. “You
know, Burton, if you hadn’t had a crack on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
head you’d never have let me say this; you’d have
flung off in a temper long ago; and I’ve had it on
my mind for some weeks and I consider that I’ve
got it coming to me to get rid of it. Now, if it isn’t
unreasonable to ask, Burton, what’s the answer
to the whole business? Have you lost your interest
in football, in the Team? Are you disgruntled
because you didn’t make the captaincy? I certainly
expected you to, and I’ll say frankly that
I was disappointed that you didn’t. Or have you
taken a personal dislike to me as a coach? There’s
some explanation, and I’m curious to know what
it is.”</p>

<p>After a moment Chick answered dispiritedly:
“I don’t know, sir. I—maybe if my head didn’t
ache— Anyway, it’s nothing to do with you, Mr.
Cade. I suppose I did get grouchy about not getting
the captaincy, but I don’t believe—” Chick’s
voice trailed off tiredly.</p>

<p>“I think I can answer that better, sir,” said
Bert. “He was peeved about the captaincy first,
and then he got hold of something that interested
him more than football, and, one way and another,
he just sort of lost his—his hold. I’m sure he
meant to carry on, Mr. Cade, but he let this other
thing take up his time and his thought. That’s
true, isn’t it, Chick?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. Hang it, I didn’t really mean
to mess things up so, Mr. Cade. Somehow I got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
started wrong this season. I—I’m might sorry.
I didn’t meant to let you down, sir. Or make
things harder for you. I—it’s like Bert says; I
got interested in something else.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad to know you didn’t mean it,
Burton. I’m glad that this other interest explains
it. Personally, I couldn’t find pool of more interest
than football, but we’re not all alike.”</p>

<p>Perhaps he saw Chick’s look of surprise, for
he went on in explanation. “You see, I’ve got a
friend in town who works on the Alton paper.
Perhaps you know him; Joe Manter. Joe drops
in here quite frequently and he brings me the news.
About a month or so ago he asked about you. He
had been seeing you in Mooney’s billiard place
pretty frequently, and sometimes quite late. Joe
thought I ought to know that you weren’t keeping
hours. I told him I already knew it, as I did; or,
at least, as I suspected. You’ll remember that we
met one evening on the street about the time you
should have been in bed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Chick. “I’ve been playing pool
a good deal at Mooney’s and I’ve been getting back
to school pretty late; sometimes nearly eleven. I
might as well tell the truth, sir.”</p>

<p>“Eleven!” gasped Bert. “How the dickens did
you ever get by Peg?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Usually he was half asleep
when I passed his door.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, of course, that sort of thing didn’t help
you much to make a showing on the field,” commented
the coach. “I considered getting after you
once or twice, Burton, but I decided each time to
keep my hands off. Now, one more thing. Joe
Manter was in to see me this forenoon and he told
me that an acquaintance of yours, a fellow named
Devore, is getting some of his friends around
town to put money up to bet on the game next
week. Have you heard anything about that?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. That is, he did say something to me
a week or more ago about betting on the game.
Advised me to get hold of some money and bet it
on Kenly. He said Kenly was certain to win this
year and that he could get me odds when the time
came. But that was all that was said. He hasn’t
mentioned it to me lately.”</p>

<p>“Did you give him any money to bet?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I didn’t have any. I guess I wouldn’t
have bet it that way, anyhow!”</p>

<p>“Ever talk football with Devore?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, sir, quite often.”</p>

<p>“Well, what was said? Was he interested in
football?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’d say he was. He talked about it a good
deal when we were playing pool together.”</p>

<p>“Did he seem interested in our plays or our signals?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I don’t remember that he ever showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
much interest in things like plays and signals. We
just talked about the game in general, and about
last year’s game and all that.”</p>

<p>“I see. You’re certain you didn’t explain anything
about this year’s plans or the plays we were
using or our signal code?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I don’t think— Well, maybe I did tell
him something about some of the plays. He’d get
to boosting Kenly and knocking our team, sir,
and saying that we didn’t have any plays that
would score. Maybe I did talk a bit too much.
Did I do any harm, sir?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I don’t know, Burton. This Devore
chap has a bad name, Joe tells me. He got
fired from a job in the freight office about a year
ago when he was suspected of stealing a small
amount of money. Since then he’s been depending
on his pool playing and on betting for a living.
Joe thinks that Devore has got hold of something
regarding our team, plays, signals, something or
other, that he can hand on to Kenly. He’s trying
to get hold of enough money to bet against Alton
to make a killing, it seems. That’s Joe’s notion.
But I don’t believe that Kenly would profit in any
such way. I know the coach over there, and he’s
a square chap. It may be that Devore has wormed
something out of you, Burton, or thinks he has, and
means to let us know next week, Saturday perhaps,
that he has it and try to make us believe that he’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
spilled it to Kenly. He probably figures that
we’d have to change our plans at the last moment
and that if we did we’d lose the game. Joe says
he hears from Lakeville that several bets have
already been laid over there on Kenly, which
makes it look as if Devore was working with some
one there. Of course it would help us considerably
if you could recall just what you told Devore, Burton;
what plays were discussed, for instance.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could,” said Chick hopelessly. “Honestly,
though, I don’t see how he could make anything
out of what I said, Mr. Cade. We never
talked signals, and, anyway, it was before we’d
changed to the new ones. Maybe I did explain two
or three plays to him, but I don’t believe he understood
them or could remember them, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cade shook his head. “He could if he set
out to, I’m afraid. Look here, it’s nearly eleven,
and you chaps will have to hustle. When you get
a good chance, Burton, I want you to sit down
and go over your talks with Devore and try to
recall about what was said by you regarding the
team. It may be that Devore hasn’t a thing in the
world and that the whole business is poppycock,
but I’d like to be certain one way or another. Will
you do that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Chick despondently. “Gosh,
I seem to have made a complete mess of everything!
I wish some one had hit me on the head a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
couple of months ago, and hit a lot harder! I—I’m
beastly ashamed of myself, Mr. Cade, and it’s
certainly mighty white of you to—to take it so
decently!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. Don’t trouble about it too
much. Get to bed now, have a good sleep and see
me to-morrow.”</p>

<small>TOMMY ISSUES AN ULTIMATUM</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Very little was said on the way back to Upton,
partly because there was little time remaining before
eleven o’clock and it was necessary to hurry,
and partly because both boys were busy with their
thoughts. Once Bert said in puzzled tones:
“Funny Devore wrote to you in a railroad envelope
if he got fired a year ago, Chick.”</p>

<p>“Probably took a supply of them home,” answered
Chick. “Just about what he would do,
swipe the office stationery. He must have run out
of letter-heads, though, because he wrote on a sheet
of plain paper. Did you hear what Johnny said?
That Devore made his living shooting pool? Gosh,
he played me for an easy mark, all right! I’m
going to find that guy and push his face in if it’s
the last thing I do.”</p>

<p>Nearing the dormitory Bert spoke again. “I
didn’t mention it to Johnny, Chick, but the day
Devore came up to the room after his money, you
know, he tried to pump me. I didn’t think anything
about it at the time, but I guess he was after
some dope on our plays.”</p>

<p>“And you didn’t tell him a blamed thing, I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
bet,” replied Chick bitterly. “It took me to spill
the beans. You wait till I see that rat!”</p>

<p>There was an explanation to be made to Mr.
Peghorn before they could climb the stairs to
Number 21. “Peg” didn’t seem to consider the
excuse sufficient, in view of Chick’s disreputable
appearance, and promised suspiciously to take the
matter up with Mr. Cade, but he released them
presently and they were in the room when eleven
struck. Bert went to sleep soon after his head
touched the pillow, but in the opposite bed Chick
lay and stared into the dark until long after
midnight.</p>

<p>Bert went off to church the next morning without
his room-mate, for Chick’s head was badly
swollen and he had no difficulty in getting excused.
After dinner the latter disappeared and Bert surmised
that he had gone over to see Mr. Cade. He
returned about four, looking more cheerful than
Bert had seen him look for many days. Bert
brushed the Sunday paper away and sat up on the
window-seat.</p>

<p>“Did you see him?” he asked.</p>

<p>Chick nodded, shied his cap to the bed and sat
down. “Yes,” he said. He stared thoughtfully
at his shoes a minute and then raised his gaze to
Bert and announced earnestly: “He’s a mighty
good chap, Bert.” He waited, as though expecting
contradiction, and when Bert only nodded, he went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
on. “Say, he’s going to be married. He told me
all about it and showed me the girl’s picture.
She’s a corker, Bert. He’s got it bad, but I don’t
blame him.”</p>

<p>“When’s it going to happen?”</p>

<p>“December, if it does happen.”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought you just said—”</p>

<p>“It’s like this. We had a long talk and he told
me all about it. He says it all depends on whether
we beat Kenly, Bert. If we do he’s going to quit
here and give all his time to his business. He’s got
a sort of a law practice at home, it seems. Then
he will get married around Christmas time. But
he says he won’t quit if we’re licked. Not unless
faculty asks him to, and I guess that isn’t likely
after what he’s done other years, eh? He says
if this season turns out to be a failure he will hang
on until he comes through right. Wants to retire
as a success and not a failure. Something like
that.”</p>

<p>“Still,” objected Bert, “I don’t see why he
can’t get married just the same. I fancy the girl
isn’t going to mind if Kenly licks us!”</p>

<p>“No, but it’s something about money. As I understood
it he doesn’t want to marry until he’s
settled down in his law practice and can stay at
home and attend to things. Anyway, that’s the
dope. Of course I said I hoped we’d beat Saturday,
and—well, what do you suppose he said?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>“Said he hoped so, too, probably.”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘How hard do you hope it, Burton?’
I said that I hoped it a whole lot, or something
like that. ‘Well, do you hope it hard enough to
pitch in and help us?’ he asked. I said I sure did.
Then—well, he talked a lot. Made me feel sort of
small, Bert. You know, when you come right down
to it, I’ve been an awful fizzle this fall!”</p>

<p>“What I want to know is, is he going to let you
play?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I think so. He didn’t promise
it, though. What he said was that I was to start
in to-morrow and forget everything but football
and beating Kenly and show what I could do. I
guess he doesn’t feel like sticking me in ahead of
Fitz, and I don’t blame him, because, say what you
like, Fitz is a mighty good end, Bert.”</p>

<p>Bert suppressed a grin. “Then all he agreed
to was letting you show what you can do, eh?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t agree to anything,” responded Chick
a trifle warmly. “He made me see what a blamed
poor piece of cheese I’ve been this season and
asked me to help him come through with a win.
And that on top of all this other business! I’ll say
that’s fair enough, and I’m ready to do everything
I can so he can get married like he wants to. Of
course I want to beat Kenly, too, but I’m in it now
so that girl won’t have to wait another year. So
he won’t, either. What’s wrong with that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not a thing,” replied Bert. “Only the girl
must be a peach, Chick, to get you all het up like
this!”</p>

<p>“She is,” replied Chick stoutly. “But I’m not
het up, you blamed cynic. I’m just mighty grateful
to Johnny for not raising the old Ned about
Les Devore. He might have been nasty, for I
certainly did a lot of fool talking with my mouth.”</p>

<p>“What about that? Could you remember saying
anything to Devore that would matter?”</p>

<p>“I said plenty,” answered Chick grimly. “I
told him about two or three plays; drew them out
for him with a piece of billiard chalk on the table
one night. I remembered it last night after I got
to bed. That Number 14 was one of them. He
insisted that we didn’t have anything but old stuff
and wouldn’t let me tell him anything different
and I drew the plays out so he could get them. Of
course it was a perfectly idiotic thing to do, but I
never suspected that he was anything but the
dumb-bell he seemed to be.”</p>

<p>“Wow!” muttered Bert. “What did Johnny
say to that?”</p>

<p>“Well, he took it mighty nice, like I’ve been
trying to tell you. He said he guessed we could
get along without Number 14 if we had to, and that
a couple of other plays didn’t amount to anything
anyway. He says he thinks Devore’s game is
mostly bluff; that Devore will come around about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
next Saturday and pretend to be hep to our whole
line of offense and show that Number 14 and a
couple of other plays to prove it. His idea is that
we’ll get cold feet and shove a lot of good plays
into the discard and get rattled generally. Johnny
says Devore couldn’t get the Kenly folks to touch
his dope with a pair of tongs, and probably doesn’t
mean to try.”</p>

<p>“I can’t just see him going to Johnny with that
line of talk,” mused Bert. “I guess he’d be afraid
to.”</p>

<p>“No, but he’d write a letter, maybe, or send
some one else. Anyhow, Johnny doesn’t seem worried
much, and that makes me feel a heap better
than I did last night. There’s one thing, though,
that’s not so good,” he added glumly.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“He made me promise to keep away from Devore.
Anyway, until after the game. And I suppose
by that time I’ll get over my mad and the
little rat never will get what’s coming to him!”</p>

<p>“Hard lines,” laughed Bert. “Maybe Johnny
has something in mind for Devore, though. I
wouldn’t be surprised, Chick.”</p>

<p>Chick brightened. “Say, I never thought of
that! I wonder! I hope he has!”</p>

<p>Chick had a lot more to say, much of it repetition
of what had gone before, and talked until darkness
settled in Number 21. Bert encouraged him, heartily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
glad that the old enthusiastic Chick had returned.
Chick was all for self-sacrifice and service,
eager to make amends, filled with a new fervor
of loyalty. It might not last, but Bert hoped it
would. The loyalty seemed to be more toward Mr.
Cade than toward the Team or the School, but that
was not important. Results were what counted.</p>

<p>There was a long, rather halting period of practice
on Monday, with most of the time given to
smoothing out the plays to be used against the
ancient enemy. Bert shared the backfield with Ted
Ball, Nip Storer and Jim Galvin during the drill
and during a large part of the scrimmage with the
Second. He discovered that he felt more at home
there than before, that he seemed to fit in better.
Perhaps he only imagined it, but it did appear as
though Nip and he worked together particularly
well, and he had a feeling that Nip thought so too.
He began to suspect that Ted had known what he
was talking about Saturday evening and that it
was possible after all that Mr. Cade meant to start
him against Kenly.</p>

<p>Chick was a revelation that day, and continued
as such right through the week, or at least until
the end of practice on Thursday. Thursday saw
the last hard work of the season. Chick was like
the player who had held down the right end position
last fall; into everything hard, fighting every
minute, taking knocks and giving them with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
laugh, tackling like a demon and tackling for keeps,
pulling down passes even when it seemed they
couldn’t be reached and comporting himself generally
during those four last days like the brilliant
player that he really was. Fitz Savell fought him
desperately, performing great deeds himself in a
despairing effort to hold his place, and the Team
and the School talked and marveled and credited a
miracle. It was Tommy Parish who advanced the
theory, based on the two-inch wound that decorated
Chick’s forehead, that Chick had had an operation
performed on his brain!</p>

<p>Tommy didn’t accept Chick’s come-back with
any enthusiasm. To Tommy the rejuvenation was
too good to be true; at least too good to be permanent.
He stated to all and sundry that it was
merely a flash in the pan, a grand-stand play that
wasn’t to be taken seriously. He wandered into
Number 21 Thursday morning between recitations,
when the open door revealed Bert alone over a
book, and eased himself against the closed portal
and lugubriously munched nuts until the host took
cognizance of his presence.</p>

<p>“Get out of here, Tommy, you and your everlasting
peanuts,” said Bert sternly. “I’ve got a
recitation in fifteen minutes and two more pages
of this stuff to go over. Fade away, son!”</p>

<p>“These aren’t peanuts,” replied Tommy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
funereal gravity, “they’re pecans. Have some?”</p>

<p>“No, and you heard what I said.”</p>

<p>“Sure.” But Tommy didn’t move. “Say, tell
me this, will you, Bert? Is Chick going to get into
that game day after to-morrow? First-off, I
mean.”</p>

<p>“How the dickens do I know? But why
shouldn’t he? Hasn’t he been playing corking
good football lately?”</p>

<p>“Lately? Three or four days, yes. That
doesn’t mean anything. Put him in against
Kenly and he’ll play as rotten as ever.”</p>

<p>“Oh, forget it, Tommy. And get out of here before
I lam you with a book.”</p>

<p>“I’m going. Don’t be so jumpy. Say, you want
to look after your nerves for a couple of days,
Bert, or you’ll be shot to pieces by Saturday. You
ought to take long walks and—”</p>

<p>“I’m going to take a short walk in just about
three seconds,” answered Bert grimly, “and it’s
going to end where you’re standing, Tommy.”</p>

<p>“No, but honest, Bert. Long walks are what you
need.” Bert pushed back his chair and Tommy
moved with a celerity no one would have suspected
him capable of. “All right, all right! Keep your
dickey on! But, say, let me tell you something,
will you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you make it mighty short.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, it’s this. I don’t approve of Johnny
starting Chick next Saturday and I’m going to see
that he doesn’t.”</p>

<p>“You are! <em>You</em> are! Don’t make me laugh,
Tommy! How are you going to do it?”</p>

<p>“I know a way. I warned you a week ago that
I didn’t intend to see the Team beaten, when it
doesn’t need to be, by playing second-raters. You
tell Chick for me that I’m out to get him. I
don’t want to tell tales, but when it’s a duty—”</p>

<p>“Tommy, you’re sickening,” said Bert.
“You’ve got it in for Chick for no reason at all
and you’re making an ass of yourself about it.
You take my advice and shut up, or—”</p>

<p>“I have not got it in for Chick,” declared
Tommy emphatically. “Maybe I don’t like him
much, but that’s got nothing to do with this. This
is something between me and—and my conscience!
I—I’ve got feelings. Just because I can’t play
football, or much of anything, fellows think I don’t
know about such things. I’m just a joke because
I’m sort of stumpy and have boils on my neck!
Well, I’ve got more—more patriotism than most
of ’em, doggone ’em!” Tommy actually choked
and a tear trickled from the corner of one eye.
“I’m for the School and the Team, Bert, and I
want to see Kenly everlastingly licked. And
that’s why I say Johnny hasn’t any right to take
risks by playing Chick Burton or any other fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
who isn’t a topnotcher. If he wants to put Chick
in for a little while after the game’s cinched, all
right. I’m not kicking about that. But Chick’s
just soldiered all season, and you know it, and
Johnny knows it, and what he’s been doing the
last two or three days can’t make up for a whole
two months of rotten playing!”</p>

<p>“Well, for Heaven’s sake!” gasped Bert.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” said Tommy, blinking hard. “I tell
you I’ve got feelings! And that’s why I’m going
to tell Johnny what I know about Chick, even if it
is low-down. I’m thinking about the Team, I tell
you, and Chick and Johnny—and you, too—can go
to the dickens!”</p>

<p>“What do you know about Chick?” demanded
Bert, not certain whether he wanted to laugh or get
mad.</p>

<p>“I know that he hasn’t been keeping hours more
than a third of the time. You said Mooney was a
friend of Chick’s in the village. Well, I found out
about Mooney’s, and I’ve seen Chick shooting pool
there many a night long after ten o’clock. And
that’s why he’s been so rotten all season. One
reason, anyway. I’ve got as much interest in the
Football Team as any one else, and I’m not going
to see a fellow who won’t even keep in training
get placed on—”</p>

<p>“Johnny knows all about that, Tommy,” interrupted
Bert, “and so you can save your breath.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, he does! That’s likely, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It’s true nevertheless. He’s known it all the
season. Don’t go and tell tales when there’s nothing
to be gained by it, Tommy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it! He’s your chum and you’re
just trying to save him. But you can’t fool me like
that, Bert. I’ve warned you, mind! You tell Chick
what I say, because I don’t want to do him dirt.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like it,” laughed Bert. “What do you
call it then?”</p>

<p>“I’m working for the Team, I tell you! I’d do
the same thing if it was you, or Ted Ball, or Jonas
Lowe! Chick’s double-crossed Johnny and the
rest of us all the fall and he can’t pull any grand-stand
stuff now and get away with it while I’ve
got a tongue. He’s cheated, and he’s got to take
his medicine!”</p>

<p>“Tommy, I tell you that Johnny knows all
you’re going to tell him. I give you my word.
You’ll just make yourself look silly if you go to
him with—”</p>

<p>“You’re lying, Bert.” Tommy shook his head
gently. “It’s all right, though. He’s your
friend.” Tommy’s hand wandered toward a
pocket mechanically. “I’m sorry I’ve got to do
this.” He stuffed a few nut kernels in his mouth
and opened the door behind him. “Tell you what
I’ll do, Bert. I’ll give Chick until after dinner to
think it over. That’s fair. You tell him I say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
he’s got to keep off the team Saturday. If he
agrees to that I’m satisfied. But you let me know,
see? If I don’t hear from you by half-past one
I’m going to Johnny and spill the whole thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go to the dickens,” fumed Bert. “Get
out of here, you crazy nut! Beat it!”</p>

<p>“One-thirty,” said Tommy hopefully as he disappeared.
“You talk to him, Bert. Tell him I
say it’ll be all right—”</p>

<p>The door slammed shut just before a copy of
“Eugénie Grandet” reached it.</p>

<p>Thursday brought the season’s preparations to an
end, saw the Second Team disband—with noisy
and appropriate ceremonies—and witnessed the
appearance of the Football Number of the “Doubleay.”
The weekly was still brimming with optimism
on the subject of the Kenly game, but,
like more important publications, it was careful to
leave itself an avenue of retreat guarded by “Ifs.”
Nevertheless the two-page article was encouraging
reading to those who wanted Alton Academy to
win and who were timorous about expecting her to.
Of course there was the usual biographical paragraph
regarding each of the players and the absorbing
statistics of age, height and weight. And,
finally, came “the probable line-up for Saturday’s
game,” as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Bert rather expected Chick to voice objection to
being relegated to second place by the “Flubdub,”
for the impression about the Academy was that he
had proved his right to start the game, an impression
that Chick doubtless shared. But there
wasn’t even a murmur from him, and Bert
marveled. Bert had his own problem to solve,
which was why Ness’s name had been set down for
the right half-back position. Ness hadn’t played
at right more than half a dozen times during the
fall and surely not since mid-season. He was first
substitute for Storer, and as such a very valuable
member for the team. In the end, after mentally
considering all sorts of backfield combinations that
included Tyron and Keys and Walsh and even
Parkhurst, Bert concluded that the “Flubdub”
had merely made a mistake. The “Flubdub” had
been known to!</p>

<p>Commencing Tuesday, there was a cheer meeting
every night that week. Mr. Cade had advised
the members of the squad to stay away from them,
and they did, but that didn’t prevent them from
hearing a good deal of the enthusiasm, for almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
always the gathering in the auditorium, so soon
as the arranged program was concluded, adjourned
to the campus and started a fresh and impromptu
celebration which usually kept up until a faculty
member appeared on the scene. Friday evening
the outdoor portion of the event was more than
ordinarily prolonged and hectic, the students
marching from hall to hall, pausing in front of each
for songs or cheers or both, and finally winding up
in front of the Principal’s residence. In the dormitories,
non-participants—squad members almost
without exception—leaned from open windows and
looked and hearkened with varying emotions. In
21 Upton, Bert and Chick and Dutch Kruger foregathered
at the casement and watched the ragged
procession moving across the sward from Haylow
to the little mansard-roofed house that stood
by itself on the south edge of the campus. They
were singing “Gray-and-Gold,” and heard at that
distance it sounded rather impressive, rather
stirring.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Gray-and-Gold! Gray-and-Gold!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Let your colors brave unfold,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wave away, bring dismay<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To the foe we meet to-day.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">March along, brave and strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Alton comes with cheer and song.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Naught can hold ’gainst courage bold!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Rah! Hurrah! for the Gray-and-Gold!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>
<p>The song ended and the cheering began. The
dark mass spread fan-shaped in front of the house.
A light appeared in the hall. The cheering subsided.
“Can you hear him?” whispered Dutch.
Chick shook his head. “No. Just a word now
and then. Not missing much, though, for Mac
says the same thing every year!” “‘Self-sacrifice
and devotion,’” murmured Bert. “I got
that much.” The audience broke into a long
“A-a-aye!” of applause, was silent again. Chick
yawned and drew away from the window. “He’s
good for another ten minutes, fellows.” “Well,
I’m not,” said Bert. Dutch held up his hand
and waved an imaginary megaphone. “Now,
fellows!” he cried earnestly, aping a cheer leader.
“Three long sneers for Kenly! Every one into
it! All together and let’s <em>go</em>!” The imaginary
megaphone was tossed aside, Dutch threw up his
arms, bent sideways, twiddled his fingers and
swung his hands in an arc as he straightened his
body.</p>

<p>“<em>Sni-i-if! Sni-i-if! Sni-i-if! Ken-le-e-ey!</em>”</p>

<p>“Rotten!” scolded Dutch, shaking a fist in their
faces. “They couldn’t hear that across the field!
Try it again and make it good, fellows! <em>Come
on!</em>”</p>

<p>“Can’t,” laughed Chick. “I’ve bust my
sniffer!”</p>

<p>“Wait till I have a cold, Dutch,” said Bert.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
“Mac’s through. They’re cheering again.” He
went back to the window.</p>

<p>“<em>Doctor McPherson! Doctor McPherson! Doctor
McPherson!</em>”</p>

<p>Then Freeman Naughton’s voice in the moment
of succeeding silence, and another cheer, loud and
measured, ending with “Alton! <em>Alton!</em> ALTON!”
The throng dispersed then, came trailing
back over the grass in ones and twos and larger
groups, still singing, laughing, joyously noisy.
“Sometimes,” remarked Dutch, leaning over
Bert’s shoulder, “it seems to me the guys who get
the most fun out of football are the ones who don’t
play!”</p>

<p>“You said a mouthful,” agreed Chick.</p>

<p>There was a final session in the gymnasium Friday
evening. Some thirty-five youths sat on the
benches in front of the blackboard and three
coaches faced them. There was a much graver
note apparent to-night, the coaches spoke in lower
tones, there was less mild horse-play amongst the
fellows. Mr. Cade drew and figured with his chalk
and asked questions, and now and then one or two
of the players arose and walked or trotted in front
of the benches in explanation of a point. There
was no more drill, however, and only Mr. Cade
made anything approaching a speech, and that
didn’t bear much resemblance. After he had
ended he held up a hand, anticipating Jim Galvin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
who had sprung to his feet. “No cheering,
fellows! Leave that for to-morrow. And see that
you’ve something to cheer for! Every one
straight to the dormitories now and get to bed before
ten o’clock. Squad dismissed!”</p>

<p>But not all the squad, for he detained Ted Ball
and Chick and Bert. Mr. Lake and Mr. McFadden
remained also, deep in a discussion. Mr. Cade
straddled a bench and brought forth a voluminous
document from a pocket. “Thought you’d be interested,
Burton,” he said. “And you, too,
Hollins. Ball knows about it.” Chick accepted the
three sheets of paper, unfolded them and read,
with Bert looking over his shoulder.</p>

<p>The letter was addressed to Mr. Cade and ran
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Some of the fellows on your team have been
doing a lot of talking around town lately and
giving secrets away right and left. The writer
isn’t telling any names but if you don’t believe it
look at the end and see. Some unscrupulous parties
have given this information to the Kenly Hall
football coaches and you’ll be in a mean jam if you
use these plays and a lot more against them. They
know more than a dozen of our best plays, formations,
signals and so forth and I’m telling you this
as a sympathizer so you won’t get caught napping
and try those plays and so forth on Kenly. It’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
rotten business, Mr. Cade, and some one ought to
be made to suffer, but you know how it is when
people get a chance of making a little money.
Take the advice of a well-wisher and don’t try the
plays you were intending to use because you’ll
get licked hard if you do. Kenly Hall is hep to
the whole works and is looking for those plays. I
would sign my name only the fellows who are
doing this dirty trick would make it hot for me
if they knew I had squealed. Yours for Fair Play,
and best wishes for success,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Unknown</span>.”<br /></p>
</div>

<p>Followed two sheets on which were drawn,
rather neatly, three football plays, among them
Number 14. There were one or two minor inaccuracies,
but any one familiar with such matters
could easily have fathomed the diagrams. Chick
handed the documents back, looking questioningly
at Mr. Cade. “What are you going to do, sir?”
he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“We’re going to use the plays; that is, that 14;
the others are already discarded, you know. The
whole business is a bluff, just as we suspected.
You can read that in every line.”</p>

<p>“Gee, I hope so!” muttered Chick. “Aren’t you
going to do anything to Devore, sir?”</p>

<p>“N-no, not exactly.” Mr. Cade smiled. “It
may comfort you to know, however, that Joe Manter—I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
mentioned Joe, didn’t I?—has covered the
money put up by Mr. Devore’s—er—syndicate.
About two hundred dollars, I believe. Joe got
odds of four to five.”</p>

<p>“You mean he’s bet two hundred dollars that
we’ll win?” asked Chick incredulously.</p>

<p>The coach nodded. “About a hundred and
seventy, I believe. I don’t know how much of the
two hundred belongs to Devore, but if Kenly
loses he’s bound to be unpopular around town for
awhile!”</p>

<p>“A hundred and seventy’s a good deal of money
for a newspaper reporter to have,” observed Bert.
Mr. Cade met his gaze and nodded gravely.</p>

<p>“He didn’t put it all up himself, Hollins. I
understand that three or four others went into it.
Personally I don’t approve of betting. In the
present case, however, as a means of applying
punishment where it’s richly deserved—well, I find
justification for it!”</p>

<p>“But—but, gosh,” exclaimed Chick. “If we
don’t win the game Manter loses his money!”</p>

<p>“Undeniably, Burton,” replied the coach cheerfully.
“There is generally an element of uncertainty
in betting.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope we win,” sighed Chick.</p>

<p>“And so do I. If Joe loses his wager—” and
Mr. Cade glanced briefly at Bert— “I shall feel,
to some extent, as though it were a personal loss!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
He arose in token that the conference was at an
end and the three boys said good night. Outside,
Ted chuckled.</p>

<p>“Bet I know who the three or four are,” he said.
“He and McFadden and Lake!”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose so?” asked Bert. “Say, we’ve
got one more reason for winning, Chick; to part
Devore from his money!”</p>

<p>“I’d like to part him from his head,” growled
Chick.</p>

<p>As the chums entered Upton, Bert descried
Tommy Parish ascending the stairs. Tommy
looked back and accelerated his pace, but in the
next corridor he was still in sight as Chick opened
the door of Number 21, and as Bert prepared to
follow Chick in a loud hiss came from farther
down the hall. Tommy was beckoning. Bert
obeyed the summons and Tommy came half-way
back and spoke in whispers.</p>

<p>“Say, Bert, I thought you’d like to know that I
didn’t spill that to Johnny. I meant to, but—well,
it seemed too rotten mean. Maybe we’ll get
beaten to-morrow, but—but there are some things
a fellow just can’t do, eh? Well, so long. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À
chaque jour suffit sa peine, </i>old<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"> fève!</i>”</p>

<p>Bert felt a bit disappointed in himself that night.
Chick was very evidently nervous and wakeful and
would have talked on and on long after the light
was out, but for the life of him Bert couldn’t keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
his eyes open more than twenty minutes after his
head was on the pillow! Recalling the confessions
of Ted Ball and Lum Patten, he concluded that
there was something missing in his make-up. He
pictured Ted lying awake with Coles Wistar reading
poetry to him through the small hours and felt
a trifle sorry for himself. Quite evidently he was
missing an excitement, a thrill, that belonged to a
normal football player on the eve of a big game.
He answered Chick more and more at random, his
voice growing sleepier and sleepier, until finally—</p>

<p>He awoke to a gray world. There was mist on
the window panes and the steam pipes were clattering
loudly. Chick still slumbered, the bed-clothes
tossed and snarled about him. The clock
said six-forty-seven. Bert tried to go back to sleep
for the remaining twelve minutes, but he couldn’t.
If excitement had passed him by last night it was
in full possession of him this morning. He swung
out of bed, shivering, and looked reprovingly at
the misted windows. What a day for the Big
Game!</p>

<small>ALTON CELEBRATES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>These was no moisture in the little easterly wind
that blew across the field when Alton kicked off to
Kenly, but the clouds were heavy and the afternoon
was gray and chill. Lack of sunshine, however,
had not affected the attendance. The stands
were filled, the rows of settees from the gymnasium
and chairs from the halls were occupied and the
crowd spilled over the ground in large numbers
and sat on rugs, newspapers, anything that would
serve. Alton was present, Academy and town, and
so to a lesser degree was Lakeville. Gray-and-gold
banners, arm-bands and megaphones lighted
one side of the field, the cherry-and-black of
Kenly sprinkled the other. Earnest youths, white-sweatered,
bareheaded, gesticulated and cavorted
while rival cheers and songs rose to the sullen sky.
At two o’clock, having won the toss, Kenly spread
her warriors over the north end of the gridiron.
Warriors they looked, too, rangy, broad-shouldered
youths, red-sleeved, black-helmeted. Captain
Jonas swung a sturdy leg and the ball rose in
the air. But there were no tees that year and the
pigskin’s flight was short and low. Alton’s backs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
were far from the catcher and Kenly lined up on
her thirty-four.</p>

<p>Two plunges, with a tackle carrying, ripped the
Alton line wide and made it first down almost in
the middle of the field. But a third attempt was
stopped short and a full-back smash on Wick
yielded but two yards. Kenly shifted to the left
and sent her quarter through Lowe for four more.
Then, however, with four to go, Kenly had to
punt. The effort, aided slightly by a gust of wind,
was good for forty yards and dropped close to the
side-line and into Storer’s arms. Nip made six before
he was nailed by a Kenly end and the ball lay
on the Alton twenty-one. Galvin tried the left
wing from punting position but was unable to gain,
and on the second down Storer kicked to the enemy’s
forty-six where Dutch Kruger slammed the
catcher to the earth. Time was taken out for
Kenly while her quarter-back was ministered to.</p>

<p>The Cherry-and-Black showed her system then.
Using a shift she divided the attack and alternated
the ball between the short and long side of the line,
gaining first down on three plunges and again on
four. Alton was puzzled by the method and had
difficulty in finding the runner. The Kenly backs
were heavy and, although they started slow and
failed to get under full steam by the time they
reached the line, they gained consistently. Gus
Thomas was hurt and Dozier took his place at left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
tackle. Alton tightened up on her thirty-three
yards and Kenly used two downs to make four
yards through the line. A short pass over the
center was knocked down by Storer. The enemy
right guard was pulled out of the line and sent
back to near the forty-yard line. That Kenly
meant to try a field-goal from there seemed improbable.
The ball went to the kicker, however,
and he swung his leg before he sprang off to
the right. Dozier attempted a tackle and was
brushed aside and the runner, swinging wide,
eluded Storer and kept on until he was run out
on the fourteen.</p>

<p>That Alton was due to be scored on was fairly
certain, and cherry-and-black banners waved
wildly. One smash at the center of the defending
team put Kenly on the twelve. Then, using the
puzzling shift and split attack, the enemy right
half charged past Haines and went to the three
yards with Bert attached to his waist. It was Galvin
who brought him down. It took two attempts
to get the Kenly full-back across the goal line, but
get there he did, choosing Captain Jonas as a final
victim.</p>

<p>Bert lined up under his goal post fuming at himself
for not making a better tackle. If he had got
lower that runner would never have reeled off nine
yards. He should have stopped him well short of
the five. Regrets, however, were vain, for there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
was the ball sailing over the cross-bar and Kenly
had a nice seven-point lead!</p>

<p>Again Captain Lowe booted the ball from midfield,
and this time it sailed high and far and
Savell and Haines were both ready for the catcher
on his twelve yards and no amount of squirming
could get him free. The whistle blew for the
period then.</p>

<p>Alton retreated slowly to the enemy’s twenty-six,
and there Kenly punted. The kick went for
only twenty-four yards and it was Storer who
pulled it down and, with Ted Ball speeding ahead,
eluded two of the enemy and carried back to Kenly’s
thirty-six before he was smothered. On the
first play Bert took the ball and tried a straight
plunge past tackle, making a scant two. Galvin
smashed into the left of the line for two more.
Galvin then threw a forward-pass to the left and
Storer missed it by inches. Storer went back to
the forty-yard line and punted to the seven.
Kenly let the ball roll over and lined up on her
twenty. On the first play she was caught off-side
and was set back. A fake kick with the punter
sliding off Haines got four yards and then Kenly
punted to Alton’s forty-three, Ball catching and
coming back six.</p>

<p>A sweep to the left, with Galvin carrying, netted
seven, and the same play with Bert in possession
added four more. Storer smashed out two through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the opposing right guard and then threw straight
over center to Bert, who, although fairly carried
back by the secondary defense, netted six more.
With two yards to go on third down Bert shot off
around the left behind a wall of interference, cut
in sharply and eluded four tacklers before he was
hurled to earth on the Kenly eighteen. That
tackle left Bert flat and time was called. When he
was on his feet again there was Larry Walsh reporting
and Bert trailed sadly off, sadly and sorely
too, for the termination of that eleven-yard dash
had been a thing of bursting stars and whirling
moons!</p>

<p>It was Walsh who ate his way by short, irresistible
attacks on the enemy line from the eighteen
yards to the seven, Walsh only once relieved by
Galvin. The chain had to be dragged in to decide
matters after the eighth down, but Alton was safe
by a few inches. Storer went wide for a scant yard
and left the ball nearly in front of the posts, with
less than forty seconds of playing time left. Galvin
retired to the fifteen-yard line, took the pass
from Patten, faked a drop-kick and hurled straight
past the right-hand goal post to Savell. Fitz, although
apparently hopelessly surrounded by foes,
pulled the pigskin down and went to earth four
yards behind the line!</p>

<p>Storer added a point from the try and Alton
shouted frantically and loudly. Coach Cade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
rushed Cahill, Howard and Lovell in and Patten,
Haines and Ball retired. Kenly kicked off to Bus
Lovell on the latter’s seven yards, Bus ran nearly
across the field in an effort to find a hole in the
charging line of enemy players and finally was
thrown for a yard loss. And then an asthmatic
horn ended the half.</p>

<p>For fifteen minutes the rival cheering sections
entertained with song while anxious enthusiasts
discussed past and future. So far neither team
had shown an attack quite good enough to warrant
implicit faith on the part of its friends.
Kenly had actually gained more ground by rushing
and had proved herself somewhat more irresistible
than Alton, but no great advantage had
been exhibited by either contender. So far as the
final outcome was concerned, that first half might
as well not have been played.</p>

<p>Alton took the field again about as she had ended
the second period, the only difference in her line-up
being at right end where Chick had succeeded
Savell. Kenly kicked off and Alton caught on her
twelve yards and went to the sixteen before she
was stopped. On three sweep plays Galvin and
Storer made it first down on the twenty-eight.
Galvin tried a long pass down the field, but Storer
failed to get near it and the ball grounded. Walsh
poked his way through the right for three yards
and then was stopped behind his line for a loss of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
two. Storer punted to Kenly’s thirty where a
back fumbled and finally, closely pursued by Chick,
fell on the ball near his twenty. Alton was caught
holding in the line and Kenly went to the twenty-six
and started on a march that brought her finally
to the enemy forty-two. There Alton called on the
services of Hop Meecham and Lum Patten and
stopped the invasion. Kenly tried a forward-pass,
which failed, and then punted.</p>

<p>Lovell was thrown hard on his five-yard line and
gave way to Ted Ball. Storer got free around left
end and reeled off eight yards before he was
thrown out of bounds. Walsh failed to gain in the
line and Storer punted to Kenly’s forty where
Chick nailed the catcher. On the first play Kenly
fumbled and recovered for a seven-yard loss. An
off-side penalty set her farther back and, after a
sweep that was good for two yards, she punted to
Storer on Alton’s forty-four. Galvin made three
and then four more. Walsh was stopped for no
gain, and with three to go on fourth down, Ball
used a double-pass and sent Storer around left end
for five. The third period ended.</p>

<p>Bert went in and Walsh retired. On the first
play from the Kenly twenty-seven Bert took the
ball from Patten and shot around left end behind
strong interference. Past the line, he was hit by a
tackler and went down. But he rolled over, found
his feet and went on again to the fifteen. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
a second enemy launched himself at the runner,
missed and sent Bert once more to earth. Rolling,
Bert went nearly to the five-yard line. There he
once more recovered himself and, dodging a third
tackler, went over!</p>

<p>Ted Ball tried to kick the goal but sent the pigskin
into the line instead, and Alton had to be
satisfied with the six points. It sounded as though
she was!</p>

<p>Kenly kicked off to Howard who caught on the
sixteen and plowed through a small army of opposing
players to his twenty-two. Ted tried Number
14 for the second time and Galvin ripped
through between guard and center on the left for
twelve yards. Galvin got four more on the other
side but was hurt and gave way to Couch. Dozier
came around and slid off tackle for three and
Kruger made the same trip for three more and first
down on the Alton forty-five. Kenly broke
through and stopped Storer for a loss. Ball
scampered around the right for three and Bert
added two off tackle on the other side of the line.
Storer went back to the forty-two yards and faked
a punt, throwing the pigskin far and to the right.
Chick found no one to dispute his right to the ball,
made a clean catch of it and went on along the
side-line from the fifty to the twenty-six, where
he was forced out.</p>

<p>Kenly tried desperately to turn back the invasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
and twice stopped plays at tackle. On third
down, however, Storer threw a short pass to Bert
and <a href="#image01">once more Bert gave an imitation of a corkscrew</a>.
He caught on the sixteen, slipped out of
a tackler’s arms, zigzagged to the ten-yard line,
was almost stopped there but got free again and
was finally brought down on the four, just short of
his goal. Storer tried the left for no gain and,
with Number 14, Couch got two of the remaining
four yards. Storer went back as if to drop-kick
and Patten shot the ball to Bert who took it on the
run and swung wide around the Kenly right wing
and went over almost without opposition close to
the corner.</p>

<p>This time Storer made the try and sent the pigskin
neatly across, and the score-board proclaimed
Kenly 7, Visitor 20, and Tommy Parish swallowed
a peanut shell and almost choked!</p>

<p>With less than three minutes left, Kenly substituted
generously and Coach Cade made a few
changes; Tate for Kruger—Dutch was about
played out—, Tifton for Captain Lowe and Ness
for Storer. Ness took the kick-off, was toppled
where he caught and then ripped off eight yards
past the Kenly left tackle. Kenly, although dismayed,
fought desperately and two downs left the
ball a half-foot short of the distance. Ted Ball
sent the backs around the right and snaked a
hidden ball over for the needed distance. Substitutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
began to appear after every play, and
presently Bert, happy but protesting, gave way to
Keys. There wasn’t much left of the first-string
line-up during the last minute or so. Kenly, too,
was presenting a practically fresh team. Alton
made her way to her forty-two yards on two dashes
by Ness, and there, with the last minute ticking
itself off, Riding, just from the side-line, dropped
back, took the ball from center and threw it across
the field to Keys and Keys threw far down into
the gray dimness to where Chick, hand upraised,
was circling in toward the center of the field.</p>

<p>The Kenly safety man was almost on him when
Chick got his fingers on the ball, but Chick was not
to be stopped. Somehow he twisted himself aside,
felt the tackler’s frantic hands slip away, staggered
back and saw a clear field ahead. But pursuit
was close behind him as he started away, pursuit
composed of friend and foe jumbled confusedly.
Perhaps Chick was thinking of the countenance
framed on Johnny Cade’s mantel, perhaps
he was remembering that here and now were his
last moments of preparatory school football, perhaps
he wasn’t thinking a thing but that thirty
yards between him and the goal. That as may
have been, he ran faster than he had ever run in
his life in a football game. Behind him interference
and attack met and dropped from the chase,
but right to the last white line a red-and-black-legged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
enemy kept on his heels, arms outstretched
for the tackle that was never made until too late.
Chick was run out when he reached the goal-line,
and he crumpled up a yard beyond it, the ball
under him and the equally exhausted pursuer flung
across his legs.</p>

<p>No one cared a mite that Pete Ness fumbled the
pass and so never had a chance to add a goal to
that touchdown. Twenty-six points were enough!
Not for years had Alton triumphed so signally
over the ancient rival, and Alton made much of
the victory. Over the field she marched, cheering,
singing, throwing caps and megaphones aloft,
while twilight gathered fast and the Kenly horde,
standing with bared heads, sung the school song.
The Alton players, heroes all, bobbed about on the
shoulders of maniacal youths, Lum Patten with
the scarred football clasped in triumph under one
tattered gray sleeve.</p>

<p>“I guess he’s got it by now,” mused Tommy
Parish. “Some present, if you <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demander moi</i>.”</p>

<p>“No one has any idea of asking you, Tommy,”
replied Bert. “As a matter of plain and unvarnished
fact, it wasn’t so blame much of a present
after all.”</p>

<p>“What? Why wasn’t it?” exclaimed Tommy,
outraged.</p>

<p>“Well, was it? There are more than four hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
fellows here and we managed to get an eighty-dollar
chest of near-silver!”</p>

<p>“Well, a lot of tightwads didn’t subscribe!”
Tommy protested.</p>

<p>“I know. That’s the answer.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you two,” grumbled Chick. “For
Pete’s sake, Tommy, don’t you ever do any studying?”</p>

<p>Tommy nodded and dropped a hand into a
pocket. The nod wasn’t an emphatic nod, for he
was undergoing an attack of boils just now, but
its meaning was plain. “Sure, I have to study,”
he replied untroubledly, “but I don’t believe in
overdoing it. Say, Chick, don’t you think the
wedding present we sent Johnny was all right?”</p>

<p>“Of course it was. He’s got enough plated
silver to last him a lifetime. Say, by the way,
the wedding’s to-morrow, isn’t it?” Chick leaned
back from the table and looked thoughtful. “Well,
I hope he will be happy. That’s sure a nice girl
he’s marrying!”</p>

<p>Bert chuckled. “I believe you’re sweet on her
yourself, Chick.”</p>

<p>Chick grinned but made no denial. Tommy said:
“Wish he’d change his mind and come back next
year, though.”</p>

<p>“He won’t,” said Chick positively. “You
fellows will have some one else to boss you next
fall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>“He won’t boss me,” said Tommy comfortably.
“Say, Chick, what train you going on Wednesday?”</p>

<p>“First one I can get. Why?”</p>

<p>“Mind if I come along? I’m only taking a small
bag home, so maybe I can help you with your
stuff.”</p>

<p>Chick shot an appealing look at Bert, but the
latter only grinned and said: “Good scheme,
Tommy. You New Yorkers must hang together.
Maybe you can get Chick to play with you a bit
during vacation!”</p>

<p>Chick uttered a howl of rage. “Shut up, you
dumb-bell! Tommy, for the love of lemons, beat
it and let me study, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” Tommy bestowed a last lingering look
of affection on Chick and ambled to the door.
There, “Well, see you to-morrow!” he added
cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid!” moaned Chick devoutly under
his breath.</p>

<p>“Night, Bert.” Tommy almost vanished.
Then, however, his round countenance came into
view again. “Say, I almost forgot, fellows!
Have some peanuts?”</p>

<p>“Let your boy grow up with Tom Slade,” is a suggestion
which thousands of parents have followed during the past,
with the result that the TOM SLADE BOOKS are the
most popular boys’ books published today. They take Tom
Slade through a series of typical boy adventures through
his tenderfoot days as a scout, through his gallant days as
an American doughboy in France, back to his old patrol
and the old camp ground at Black Lake, and so on.</p>

<p>All readers of the Tom Slade and the Roy Blakeley
books are acquainted with Pee-wee Harris. These stories
record the true facts concerning his size (what there is of
it) and his heroism (such as it is), his voice, his clothes,
his appetite, his friends, his enemies, his victims. Together
with the thrilling narrative of how he foiled, baffled, circumvented
and triumphed over everything and everybody
(except where he failed) and how even when he failed he
succeeded. The whole recorded in a series of screams and
told with neither muffler nor cut-out.</p>

<p class="noic"><b>Handsomely Bound. Colored Wrappers. Illustrated.<br />
For Children 6 to 12 Years.</b></p>


<p>This series presents early American history in a manner
that impresses the young readers. Because of George and
Martha Washington Parke, two young descendants of the
famous General Washington, these stories follow exactly
the life of the great American, by means of playing they
act the life of the Washingtons, both in battles and in
society.</p>


<p class="noi adauthor">THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS</p>

<p>Their thrilling battles and expeditions generally end in “punishment”
lessons read by Mrs. Parke from the “Life of Washington.” The culprits
listen intently, for this reading generally gives them new ideas for further
games of Indian warfare and Colonists’ battles.</p>

<p class="noi adauthor">THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS’ RELATIVES</p>

<p>The Davis children visit the Parke home and join zealously in the games
of playing General Washington. So zealously, in fact, that little Jim
almost loses his scalp.</p>

<p class="noi adauthor">THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS’ TRAVELS</p>

<p>The children wage a fierce battle upon the roof of a hotel in New York
City. Then, visiting the Davis home in Philadelphia, the patriotic Washingtons
vanquish the Hessians on a battle-field in the empty lot back of
the Davis property.</p>

<p class="noi adauthor">THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS AT SCHOOL</p>

<p>After the school-house battle the Washingtons discover a band of gypsies
camping near the back road to their homes and incidentally they secure
the stolen horse which the gypsies had taken from the “butter and egg
farmer” of the Parkes.</p>

<p class="noi adauthor">THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS’ HOLIDAYS</p>

<p>They spend a pleasant summer on two adjoining farms in Vermont.
During the voyage they try to capture a “frigate” but little Jim is caught
and about to be punished by the Captain when his confederates hasten in
and save him.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
